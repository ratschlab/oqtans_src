A.2.6 Sparse Matrices with Mex-Files
------------------------------------

The Octave format for sparse matrices is identical to the mex format in
that it is a compressed column sparse format.  Also in both, sparse
matrices are required to be two-dimensional.  The only difference is
that the real and imaginary parts of the matrix are stored separately.

   The mex-file interface, as well as using `mxGetM', `mxGetN',
`mxSetM', `mxSetN', `mxGetPr', `mxGetPi', `mxSetPr' and `mxSetPi', the
mex-file interface supplies the functions

     mwIndex *mxGetIr (const mxArray *ptr);
     mwIndex *mxGetJc (const mxArray *ptr);
     mwSize mxGetNzmax (const mxArray *ptr);

     void mxSetIr (mxArray *ptr, mwIndex *ir);
     void mxSetJc (mxArray *ptr, mwIndex *jc);
     void mxSetNzmax (mxArray *ptr, mwSize nzmax);

`mxGetNzmax' gets the maximum number of elements that can be stored in
the sparse matrix.  This is not necessarily the number of non-zero
elements in the sparse matrix.  `mxGetJc' returns an array with one
additional value than the number of columns in the sparse matrix.  The
difference between consecutive values of the array returned by
`mxGetJc' define the number of non-zero elements in each column of the
sparse matrix.  Therefore

     mwSize nz, n;
     mwIndex *Jc;
     mxArray *m;
     ...
     n = mxGetN (m);
     Jc = mxGetJc (m);
     nz = Jc[n];

returns the actual number of non-zero elements stored in the matrix in
`nz'.  As the arrays returned by `mxGetPr' and `mxGetPi' only contain
the non-zero values of the matrix, we also need a pointer to the rows
of the non-zero elements, and this is given by `mxGetIr'.  A complete
example of the use of sparse matrices in mex-files is given by the file
`mysparse.c' as seen below

     #include "mex.h"

     mexFunction (int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs,

A.2.7 Calling Other Functions in Mex-Files
------------------------------------------

It is also possible call other Octave functions from within a mex-file
using `mexCallMATLAB'.  An example of the use of `mexCallMATLAB' can be
see in the example below

     #include "mex.h"

     void
     mexFunction (int nlhs, mxArray* plhs[], int nrhs,
                  const mxArray* prhs[])
     {
       char *str;

       mexPrintf ("Hello, World!\n");

       mexPrintf ("I have %d inputs and %d outputs\n", nrhs,
                  nlhs);

       if (nrhs < 1 || ! mxIsString (prhs[0]))
         mexErrMsgTxt ("function name expected");

       str = mxArrayToString (prhs[0]);

       mexPrintf ("I'm going to call the function %s\n", str);

       mexCallMATLAB (nlhs, plhs, nrhs-1, prhs+1, str);

       mxFree (str);
     }

   If this code is in the file `myfeval.c', and is compiled to
`myfeval.mex', then an example of its use is

     myfeval("sin", 1)
     a = myfeval("sin", 1)
     => Hello, World!
         I have 2 inputs and 1 outputs
         I'm going to call the interpreter function sin
         a =  0.84147

   Note that it is not possible to use function handles or inline
functions within a mex-file.

A.3 Standalone Programs
=======================

The libraries Octave itself uses, can be utilized in standalone
applications.  These applications then have access, for example, to the
array and matrix classes as well as to all the Octave algorithms.  The
following C++ program, uses class Matrix from `liboctave.a' or
`liboctave.so'.

     #include <iostream>
     #include <octave/oct.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       std::cout << "Hello Octave world!\n";
       int n = 2;
       Matrix a_matrix = Matrix (n, n);
       for (octave_idx_type i = 0; i < n; i++)
         {
           for (octave_idx_type j = 0; j < n; j++)
             {
               a_matrix (i, j) = (i + 1) * 10 + (j + 1);
             }
         }
       std::cout << a_matrix;
       return 0;
     }

mkoctfile can then be used to build a standalone application with a
command like

     $ mkoctfile --link-stand-alone standalone.cc -o standalone
     $ ./standalone
     Hello Octave world!
       11 12
       21 22
     $

   Note that the application `hello' will be dynamically linked against
the octave libraries and any octave support libraries.  The above
allows the Octave math libraries to be used by an application.  It does
not however allow the script files, oct-files or builtin functions of
Octave to be used by the application.  To do that the Octave interpreter
needs to be initialized first.  An example of how to do this can then be
seen in the code

     #include <iostream>
     #include <octave/oct.h>
     #include <octave/octave.h>
     #include <octave/parse.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       string_vector argv (2);
       argv(0) = "embedded";
       argv(1) = "-q";

       octave_main (2, argv.c_str_vec(), 1);

       octave_idx_type n = 2;
       Matrix a_matrix = Matrix (1, 2);

       std::cout << "GCD of [";
       for (octave_idx_type i = 0; i < n; i++)
         {
           a_matrix (i) = 5 * (i + 1);
           if (i != 0)
             std::cout << ", " << 5 * (i + 2);
           else
             std::cout << 5 * (i + 2);
         }
       std::cout << "] is ";

       octave_value_list in = octave_value (a_matrix);
       octave_value_list out = feval ("gcd", in, 1);

       if (!error_state && out.length () > 0)
         {
           a_matrix = out(0).matrix_value ();
           if (a_matrix.numel () == 1)
             std::cout << a_matrix(0) << "\n";
           else
             std::cout << "invalid\n";
         }
       else
         std::cout << "invalid\n";

       return 0;
     }

which is compiled and run as before as a standalone application with

     $ mkoctfile --link-stand-alone embedded.cc -o embedded
     $ ./embedded
     GCD of [10, 15] is 5
     $

Appendix B Test and Demo Functions
**********************************

Octave includes a number of functions to allow the integration of
testing and demonstration code in the source code of the functions
themselves.

* Menu:

* Test Functions::
* Demonstration Functions::


File: octave.info,  Node: Test Functions,  Next: Demonstration Functions,  Up: Test and Demo Functions

B.1 Test Functions
==================

 -- Command:  test NAME
 -- Command:  test NAME quiet|normal|verbose
 -- Function File:  test ('NAME', 'quiet|normal|verbose', FID)
 -- Function File:  test ([], 'explain', FID)
 -- Function File: SUCCESS = test (...)
 -- Function File: [N, MAX] = test (...)
 -- Function File: [CODE, IDX] = test ('NAME', 'grabdemo')
     Perform tests from the first file in the loadpath matching NAME.
     `test' can be called as a command or as a function.  Called with a
     single argument NAME, the tests are run interactively and stop
     after the first error is encountered.

     With a second argument the tests which are performed and the
     amount of output is selected.

    'quiet'
          Don't report all the tests as they happen, just the errors.

    'normal'
          Report all tests as they happen, but don't do tests which
          require user interaction.

    'verbose'
          Do tests which require user interaction.

     The argument FID can be used to allow batch processing.  Errors
     can be written to the already open file defined by FID, and
     hopefully when Octave crashes this file will tell you what was
     happening when it did.  You can use `stdout' if you want to see
     the results as they happen.  You can also give a file name rather
     than an FID, in which case the contents of the file will be
     replaced with the log from the current test.

     Called with a single output argument SUCCESS, `test' returns true
     if all of the tests were successful.  Called with two output
     arguments N and MAX, the number of successful tests and the total
     number of tests in the file NAME are returned.

     If the second argument is the string 'grabdemo', the contents of
     the demo blocks are extracted but not executed.  Code for all code
     blocks is concatenated and returned as CODE with IDX being a
     vector of positions of the ends of the demo blocks.

     If the second argument is 'explain', then NAME is ignored and an
     explanation of the line markers used is written to the file FID.

     *See also:* *note assert: doc-assert, *note fail: doc-fail, *note
     error: doc-error, *note demo: doc-demo, *note example: doc-example.

   `test' scans the named script file looking for lines which start
with `%!'.  The prefix is stripped off and the rest of the line is
processed through the Octave interpreter.  If the code generates an
error, then the test is said to fail.

   Since `eval()' will stop at the first error it encounters, you must
divide your tests up into blocks, with anything in a separate block
evaluated separately.  Blocks are introduced by the keyword `test'
immediately following the `%!'.  For example:

        %!test error ("this test fails!");
        %!test "test doesn't fail. it doesn't generate an error";

   When a test fails, you will see something like:

          ***** test error ('this test fails!')
        !!!!! test failed
        this test fails!

   Generally, to test if something works, you want to assert that it
produces a correct value.  A real test might look something like

        %!test
        %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; B = [1; 2];
        %! expect = [ A ; 2*A ];
        %! get = kron (B, A);
        %! if (any(size(expect) != size(get)))
        %!    error ("wrong size: expected %d,%d but got %d,%d",
        %!           size(expect), size(get));
        %! elseif (any(any(expect!=get)))
        %!    error ("didn't get what was expected.");
        %! endif

   To make the process easier, use the `assert' function.  For example,
with `assert' the previous test is reduced to:

        %!test
        %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; B = [1; 2];
        %! assert (kron (B, A), [ A; 2*A ]);

   `assert' can accept a tolerance so that you can compare results
absolutely or relatively.  For example, the following all succeed:

        %!test assert (1+eps, 1, 2*eps)          # absolute error
        %!test assert (100+100*eps, 100, -2*eps) # relative error

   You can also do the comparison yourself, but still have assert
generate the error:

        %!test assert (isempty([]))
        %!test assert ([ 1,2; 3,4 ] > 0)

   Because `assert' is so frequently used alone in a test block, there
is a shorthand form:

        %!assert (...)

which is equivalent to:

        %!test assert (...)

   Sometimes during development there is a test that should work but is
known to fail.  You still want to leave the test in because when the
final code is ready the test should pass, but you may not be able to
fix it immediately.  To avoid unnecessary bug reports for these known
failures, mark the block with `xtest' rather than `test':

        %!xtest assert (1==0)
        %!xtest fail ('success=1','error'))

   Another use of `xtest' is for statistical tests which should pass
most of the time but are known to fail occasionally.

   Each block is evaluated in its own function environment, which means
that variables defined in one block are not automatically shared with
other blocks.  If you do want to share variables, then you must declare
them as `shared' before you use them.  For example, the following
declares the variable A, gives it an initial value (default is empty),
then uses it in several subsequent tests.

        %!shared A
        %! A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
        %!assert (kron ([1; 2], A), [ A; 2*A ]);
        %!assert (kron ([1, 2], A), [ A, 2*A ]);
        %!assert (kron ([1,2; 3,4], A), [ A,2*A; 3*A,4*A ]);

   You can share several variables at the same time:

        %!shared A, B

   You can also share test functions:

        %!function A = fn(B)
        %!  A = 2*B;
        %!assert (A(2),4);

   Note that all previous variables and values are lost when a new
shared block is declared.

   Error and warning blocks are like test blocks, but they only succeed
if the code generates an error.  You can check the text of the error is
correct using an optional regular expression `<pattern>'.  For example:

        %!error <passes!> error('this test passes!');

   If the code doesn't generate an error, the test fails.  For example:

        %!error "this is an error because it succeeds.";

produces

        ***** error "this is an error because it succeeds.";
        !!!!! test failed: no error

   It is important to automate the tests as much as possible, however
some tests require user interaction.  These can be isolated into demo
blocks, which if you are in batch mode, are only run when called with
`demo' or `verbose'.  The code is displayed before it is executed.  For
example,

        %!demo
        %! T=[0:0.01:2*pi]; X=sin(T);
        %! plot(T,X);
        %! you should now see a sine wave in your figure window

produces

        > T=[0:0.01:2*pi]; X=sin(T);
        > plot(T,X);
        > you should now see a sine wave in your figure window
        Press <enter> to continue:

   Note that demo blocks cannot use any shared variables.  This is so
that they can be executed by themselves, ignoring all other tests.

   If you want to temporarily disable a test block, put `#' in place of
the block type.  This creates a comment block which is echoed in the
log file, but is not executed.  For example:

        %!#demo
        %! T=[0:0.01:2*pi]; X=sin(T);
        %! plot(T,X);
        %! you should now see a sine wave in your figure window

   Block type summary:

`%!test'
     check that entire block is correct

`%!error'
     check for correct error message

`%!warning'
     check for correct warning message

`%!demo'
     demo only executes in interactive mode

`%!#'
     comment: ignore everything within the block

`%!shared x,y,z'
     declares variables for use in multiple tests

`%!function'
     defines a function value for a shared variable

`%!assert (x, y, tol)'
     shorthand for %!test assert (x, y, tol)

   You can also create test scripts for builtins and your own C++
functions.  Just put a file of the function name on your path without
any extension and it will be picked up by the test procedure.  You can
even embed tests directly in your C++ code:

        #if 0
        %!test disp('this is a test')
        #endif

or

        /*
        %!test disp('this is a test')
        */

but then the code will have to be on the load path and the user will
have to remember to type test('name.cc').  Conversely, you can separate
the tests from normal Octave script files by putting them in plain
files with no extension rather than in script files.

 -- Function File:  assert (COND)
 -- Function File:  assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)
 -- Function File:  assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)
 -- Function File:  assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)
 -- Function File:  assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)
     Produces an error if the condition is not met.  `assert' can be
     called in three different ways.

    `assert (COND)'
    `assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)'
    `assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)'
          Called with a single argument COND, `assert' produces an
          error if COND is zero.  If called with a single argument a
          generic error message.  With more than one argument, the
          additional arguments are passed to the `error' function.

    `assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected.
          Note that observed and expected can be strings, scalars,
          vectors, matrices, lists or structures.

    `assert(OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)'
          Accept a tolerance when comparing numbers.  If TOL is
          positive use it as an absolute tolerance, will produce an
          error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL)'.  If TOL is
          negative use it as a relative tolerance, will produce an
          error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL * EXPECTED)'.
          If EXPECTED is zero TOL will always be used as an absolute
          tolerance.

 -- Function File:  fail (CODE)
 -- Function File:  fail (CODE, PATTERN)
 -- Function File:  fail (CODE, 'warning', PATTERN)
     Return true if CODE fails with an error message matching PATTERN,
     otherwise produce an error.  Note that CODE is a string and if
     CODE runs successfully, the error produced is:

                    expected error but got none

     If the code fails with a different error, the message produced is:

                    expected <pattern>
                    but got <text of actual error>

     The angle brackets are not part of the output.

     Called with three arguments, the behavior is similar to
     `fail(CODE, PATTERN)', but produces an error if no warning is
     given during code execution or if the code fails.

B.2 Demonstration Functions
===========================

 -- Command:  demo NAME N
 -- Function File:  demo ('NAME', N)
     Runs any examples associated with the function 'NAME'.  Examples
     are stored in the script file, or in a file with the same name but
     no extension somewhere on your path.  To keep them separate from
     the usual script code, all lines are prefixed by `%!'.  Each
     example is introduced by the keyword 'demo' flush left to the
     prefix, with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of the example
     can contain arbitrary Octave code.  For example:

             %!demo
             %! t=0:0.01:2*pi; x = sin(t);
             %! plot(t,x)
             %! %-------------------------------------------------
             %! % the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave

     Note that the code is displayed before it is executed, so a simple
     comment at the end suffices.  It is generally not necessary to use
     disp or printf within the demo.

     Demos are run in a function environment with no access to external
     variables.  This means that all demos in your function must use
     separate initialization code.  Alternatively, you can combine your
     demos into one huge demo, with the code:

             %! input("Press <enter> to continue: ","s");

     between the sections, but this is discouraged.  Other techniques
     include using multiple plots by saying figure between each, or
     using subplot to put multiple plots in the same window.

     Also, since demo evaluates inside a function context, you cannot
     define new functions inside a demo.  Instead you will have to use
     `eval(example('function',n))' to see them.  Because eval only
     evaluates one line, or one statement if the statement crosses
     multiple lines, you must wrap your demo in "if 1 <demo stuff>
     endif" with the 'if' on the same line as 'demo'.  For example:

            %!demo if 1
            %!  function y=f(x)
            %!    y=x;
            %!  endfunction
            %!  f(3)
            %! endif

     'NAME', but do not run it.  If N is not given, all examples are
     displayed.

     Called with output arguments, the examples are returned in the
     form of a string X, with IDX indicating the ending position of the
     various examples.

 -- Function File:  speed (F, INIT, MAX_N, F2, TOL)
 -- Function File: [ORDER, N, T_F, T_F2] = speed (...)
     Determine the execution time of an expression (F) for various input
     values (N).  The N are log-spaced from 1 to MAX_N.  For each N, an
     initialization expression (INIT) is computed to create any data
     needed for the test.  If a second expression (F2) is given then
     the execution times of the two expressions are compared.  When
     called without output arguments the results are displayed
     graphically.

    `F'
          The expression to evaluate.

    `MAX_N'
          The maximum test length to run.  Default value is 100.
          Alternatively, use `[min_n, max_n]' or specify the N exactly
          with `[n1, n2, ..., nk]'.

    `INIT'
          Initialization expression for function argument values.  Use K
          for the test number and N for the size of the test.  This
          should compute values for all variables used by F.  Note that
          INIT will be evaluated first for k = 0, so things which are
          constant throughout the test series can be computed once.
          The default value is `X = randn (N, 1)'.

    `F2'
          An alternative expression to evaluate, so that the speed of
          two expressions can be directly compared.  The default is
          `[]'.

    `TOL'
          Tolerance used to compare the results of expression F and
          expression F2.  If TOL is positive, the tolerance is an
          absolute one.  If TOL is negative, the tolerance is a
          relative one.  The default is `eps'.  If TOL is `Inf', then
          no comparison will be made.

    `ORDER'
          The time complexity of the expression O(a*n^p).  This is a
          structure with fields `a' and `p'.

    `N'
          The values N for which the expression was calculated AND the
          execution time was greater than zero.

    `T_F'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F in
          seconds.

    `T_F2'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F2 in
          seconds.  If required, the mean time ratio is simply `mean
          (T_f./T_f2)'.


     The slope of the execution time graph shows the approximate power
     of the asymptotic running time O(n^p).  This power is plotted for
     the region over which it is approximated (the latter half of the
     graph).  The estimated power is not very accurate, but should be
     sufficient to determine the general order of an algorithm.  It
     should indicate if, for example, the implementation is
     unexpectedly O(n^2) rather than O(n) because it extends a vector
     each time through the loop rather than pre-allocating storage.  In
     the current version of Octave, the following is not the expected
     O(n).

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", "", [1000, 10000])

     But it is if you preallocate the cell array `y':

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", ...
                 "x = rand (n, 1); y = cell (size (x));", [1000, 10000])

     An attempt is made to approximate the cost of individual
     operations, but it is wildly inaccurate.  You can improve the
     stability somewhat by doing more work for each `n'.  For example:

          speed ("airy(x)", "x = rand (n, 10)", [10000, 100000])

     When comparing two different expressions (F, F2), the slope of the
     line on the speedup ratio graph should be larger than 1 if the new
     expression is faster.  Better algorithms have a shallow slope.
     Generally, vectorizing an algorithm will not change the slope of
     the execution time graph, but will shift it relative to the
     original.  For example:

          speed ("v = sum (x)", "", [10000, 100000], ...
                 "v = 0; for i = 1:length (x), v += x(i); end")

     The following is a more complex example.  If there was an original
     version of `xcorr' using for loops and a second version using an
     FFT, then one could compare the run speed for various lags as
     follows, or for a fixed lag with varying vector lengths as follows:

          speed ("v = xcorr (x, n)", "x = rand (128, 1);", 100,
                 "v2 = xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)
          speed ("v = xcorr (x, 15)", "x = rand (20+n, 1);", 100,
                 "v2 = xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)

     Assuming one of the two versions is in xcorr_orig, this would
     compare their speed and their output values.  Note that the FFT
     version is not exact, so we specify an acceptable tolerance on the
     comparison `100*eps', and that the errors should be computed
     relatively, as `abs ((X - Y) ./ Y)' rather than absolutely as `abs
     (X - Y)'.

     Type `example('speed')' to see some real examples.  Note that for
     obscure reasons, examples 1 and 2 can not be run directly using
     `demo('speed')'.  Instead use, `eval ( example('speed', 1) )' or
     `eval ( example('speed', 2) )'.

C.1 Writing Clean Octave Programs
=================================

Here are some tips for avoiding common errors in writing Octave code
intended for widespread use:

   * Since all global variables share the same name space, and all
     functions share another name space, you should choose a short word
     to distinguish your program from other Octave programs.  Then take
     care to begin the names of all global variables, constants, and
     functions with the chosen prefix.  This helps avoid name conflicts.

     If you write a function that you think ought to be added to Octave
     under a certain name, such as `fiddle_matrix', don't call it by
     that name in your program.  Call it `mylib_fiddle_matrix' in your
     program, and send mail to <maintainers@octave.org> suggesting that
     it be added to Octave.  If and when it is, the name can be changed
     easily enough.

     If one prefix is insufficient, your package may use two or three
     alternative common prefixes, so long as they make sense.

     Separate the prefix from the rest of the symbol name with an
     underscore `_'.  This will be consistent with Octave itself and
     with most Octave programs.

   * When you encounter an error condition, call the function `error'
     (or `usage').  The `error' and `usage' functions do not return.
     *Note Errors::.

   * Please put a copyright notice on the file if you give copies to
     anyone.  Use the same lines that appear at the top of the function
     files distributed with Octave.  If you have not signed papers to
     assign the copyright to anyone else, then place your name in the
     copyright notice.

C.2 Tips for Making Code Run Faster.
====================================

Here are some ways of improving the execution speed of Octave programs.

   * Vectorize loops.  For instance, rather than

          for i = 1:n-1
            a(i) = b(i+1) - b(i);
          endfor

     write

          a = b(2:n) - b(1:n-1);

     This is especially important for loops with "cheap" bodies.  Often
     it suffices to vectorize just the innermost loop to get acceptable
     performance.  A general rule of thumb is that the "order" of the
     vectorized body should be greater or equal to the "order" of the
     enclosing loop.

   * Use built-in and library functions if possible.  Built-in and
     compiled functions are very fast.  Even with a m-file library
     function, chances are good that it is already optimized, or will
     be optimized more in a future release.

     For instance, even better than

          a = b(2:n) - b(1:n-1);

     is

          a = diff (b);

   * Avoid computing costly intermediate results multiple times.
     Octave currently does not eliminate common subexpressions.  Also,
     certain internal computation results are cached for variables.
     For instance, if a matrix variable is used multiple times as an
     index, checking the indices (and internal conversion to integers)
     is only done once.

   * Be aware of lazy copies (copy-on-write).  When a copy of an object
     is created, the data is not immediately copied, but rather shared.
     The actual copying is postponed until the copied data needs to be
     modified.  For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a; # no copying done here
          b(1) = 1; # copying done here

     Lazy copying applies to whole Octave objects such as matrices,
     cells, struct, and also individual cell or struct elements (not
     array elements).

     Additionally, index expressions also use lazy copying when Octave
     can determine that the indexed portion is contiguous in memory.
     For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a(:,10:100); # no copying done here
          b = a(10:100,:); # copying done here

     This applies to arrays (matrices), cell arrays, and structs
     indexed using ().  Index expressions generating cs-lists can also
     benefit of shallow copying in some cases.  In particular, when A
     is a struct array, expressions like `{a.x}, {a(:,2).x}' will use
     lazy copying, so that data can be shared between a struct array
     and a cell array.

     Most indexing expressions do not live longer than their `parent'
     objects.  In rare cases, however, a lazily copied slice outlasts
     its parent, in which case it becomes orphaned, still occupying
     unnecessarily more memory than needed.  To provide a remedy
     working in most real cases, Octave checks for orphaned lazy slices
     at certain situations, when a value is stored into a "permanent"
     location, such as a named variable or cell or struct element, and
     possibly economizes them.  For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a(:,10:100);  # lazy slice
          a = []; # the original a array is still allocated
          c{1} = b; # b is reallocated at this point

   * Avoid deep recursion.  Function calls to m-file functions carry a
     relatively significant overhead, so rewriting a recursion as a
     loop often helps.  Also, note that the maximum level of recursion
     is limited.

   * Avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily.  When building a single
     result matrix from a series of calculations, set the size of the
     result matrix first, then insert values into it.  Write

          result = zeros (big_n, big_m)
          for i = over:and_over
            r1 = ...
            r2 = ...
            result (r1, r2) = new_value ();
          endfor

     instead of

          result = [];
          for i = ever:and_ever
            result = [ result, new_value() ];
          endfor

     Sometimes the number of items can't be computed in advance, and
     stack-like operations are needed.  When elements are being
     repeatedly inserted at/removed from the end of an array, Octave
     detects it as stack usage and attempts to use a smarter memory
     management strategy pre-allocating the array in bigger chunks.
     Likewise works for cell and struct arrays.

          a = [];
          while (condition)
            ...
            a(end+1) = value; # "push" operation
            ...
            a(end) = []; # "pop" operation
            ...
          endwhile

   * Use `cellfun' intelligently.  The `cellfun' function is a useful
     tool for avoiding loops.  *Note Processing Data in Cell Arrays::.
     `cellfun' is often used with anonymous function handles; however,
     calling an anonymous function involves an overhead quite
     comparable to the overhead of an m-file function.  Passing a
     handle to a built-in function is faster, because the interpreter
     is not involved in the internal loop.  For example:

          a = {...}
          v = cellfun (@(x) det(x), a); # compute determinants
          v = cellfun (@det, a); # faster

   * Octave includes a number of other functions that can replace
     common types of loops, including `bsxfun', `arrayfun', `structfun',
     `accumarray'.  These functions can take an arbitrary function as a
     handle.  Be sure to get familiar with them if you want to become
     an Octave expert.

   * Avoid calling `eval' or `feval' excessively, because they require
     Octave to parse input or look up the name of a function in the
     symbol table.

     If you are using `eval' as an exception handling mechanism and not
     because you need to execute some arbitrary text, use the `try'
     statement instead.  *Note The `try' Statement::.

   * If you are calling lots of functions but none of them will need to
     change during your run, set the variable
     `ignore_function_time_stamp' to `"all"' so that Octave doesn't
     waste a lot of time checking to see if you have updated your
     function files.


File: octave.info,  Node: Comment Tips,  Next: Function Headers,  Prev: Coding Tips,  Up: Tips and Standards

C.3 Tips on Writing Comments
============================

Here are the conventions to follow when writing comments.

`#'
     Comments that start with a single sharp-sign, `#', should all be
     aligned to the same column on the right of the source code.  Such
     comments usually explain how the code on the same line does its
     job.  In the Emacs mode for Octave, the `M-;'
     (`indent-for-comment') command automatically inserts such a `#' in
     the right place, or aligns such a comment if it is already present.

`##'
     Comments that start with a double sharp-sign, `##', should be
     aligned to the same level of indentation as the code.  Such
     comments usually describe the purpose of the following lines or
     the state of the program at that point.

The indentation commands of the Octave mode in Emacs, such as `M-;'
(`indent-for-comment') and `TAB' (`octave-indent-line') automatically
indent comments according to these conventions, depending on the number
of semicolons.  *Note Manipulating Comments: (emacs)Comments.

C.4 Conventional Headers for Octave Functions
=============================================

Octave has conventions for using special comments in function files to
give information such as who wrote them.  This section explains these
conventions.

   The top of the file should contain a copyright notice, followed by a
block of comments that can be used as the help text for the function.
Here is an example:

     ## Copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 2007 John W. Eaton

     ## usage: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
     ##
     ## Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  COMMAND
     ## specifies the name of the command to start.  ARGS is an
     ## array of strings containing options for COMMAND.  IN and
     ## OUT are the file ids of the input and streams for the
     ## subprocess, and PID is the process id of the subprocess,
     ## or -1 if COMMAND could not be executed.
     ##
     ## Example:
     ##
     ##  [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-nr");
     ##  fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
     ##  fclose (in);
     ##  while (ischar (s = fgets (out)))
     ##    fputs (stdout, s);
     ##  endwhile
     ##  fclose (out);

   Octave uses the first block of comments in a function file that do
not appear to be a copyright notice as the help text for the file.  For
Octave to recognize the first comment block as a copyright notice, it
must start with the word `Copyright' after stripping the leading
comment characters.

   After the copyright notice and help text come several "header
comment" lines, each beginning with `## HEADER-NAME:'.  For example,

     ## Author: jwe
     ## Keywords: subprocesses input-output
     ## Maintainer: jwe

   Here is a table of the conventional possibilities for HEADER-NAME:

`Author'
     This line states the name and net address of at least the principal
     author of the library.

          ## Author: John W. Eaton <jwe@octave.org>

`Maintainer'
     This line should contain a single name/address as in the Author
     line, or an address only, or the string `jwe'.  If there is no
     maintainer line, the person(s) in the Author field are presumed to
     be the maintainers.  The example above is mildly bogus because the
     maintainer line is redundant.

     The idea behind the `Author' and `Maintainer' lines is to make
     possible a function to "send mail to the maintainer" without
     having to mine the name out by hand.

     Be sure to surround the network address with `<...>' if you
     include the person's full name as well as the network address.

`Created'
     This optional line gives the original creation date of the file.
     For historical interest only.

`Version'
     If you wish to record version numbers for the individual Octave
     program, put them in this line.

`Adapted-By'
     In this header line, place the name of the person who adapted the
     library for installation (to make it fit the style conventions, for
     example).

`Keywords'
     This line lists keywords.  Eventually, it will be used by an
     apropos command to allow people will find your package when
     they're looking for things by topic area.  To separate the
     keywords, you can use spaces, commas, or both.

   Just about every Octave function ought to have the `Author' and
`Keywords' header comment lines.  Use the others if they are
appropriate.  You can also put in header lines with other header
names--they have no standard meanings, so they can't do any harm.

C.5 Tips for Documentation Strings
==================================

As noted above, documentation is typically in a commented header block
on an Octave function following the copyright statement.  The help
string shown above is an unformatted string and will be displayed as is
by Octave.  Here are some tips for the writing of documentation strings.

   * Every command, function, or variable intended for users to know
     about should have a documentation string.

   * An internal variable or subroutine of an Octave program might as
     well have a documentation string.

   * The first line of the documentation string should consist of one
     or two complete sentences that stand on their own as a summary.

     The documentation string can have additional lines that expand on
     the details of how to use the function or variable.  The
     additional lines should also be made up of complete sentences.

   * For consistency, phrase the verb in the first sentence of a
     documentation string as an infinitive with "to" omitted.  For
     instance, use "Return the frob of A and B." in preference to
     "Returns the frob of A and B."  Usually it looks good to do
     likewise for the rest of the first paragraph.  Subsequent
     paragraphs usually look better if they have proper subjects.

   * Write documentation strings in the active voice, not the passive,
     and in the present tense, not the future.  For instance, use
     "Return a list containing A and B." instead of "A list containing
     A and B will be returned."

   * Avoid using the word "cause" (or its equivalents) unnecessarily.
     Instead of, "Cause Octave to display text in boldface," just write
     "Display text in boldface."

   * Use two spaces between the period marking the end of a sentence
     and the word which opens the next sentence.  This convention has
     no effect for typeset formats like TeX, but improves the
     readability of the documentation in fixed-width environments such
     as the Info reader.

   * Do not start or end a documentation string with whitespace.

   * Format the documentation string so that it fits within an
     80-column screen.  It is a good idea for most lines to be no wider
     than 60 characters.

     However, rather than simply filling the entire documentation
     string, you can make it much more readable by choosing line breaks
     with care.  Use blank lines between topics if the documentation
     string is long.

   * *Do not* indent subsequent lines of a documentation string so that
     the text is lined up in the source code with the text of the first
     line.  This looks nice in the source code, but looks bizarre when
     users view the documentation.  Remember that the indentation
     before the starting double-quote is not part of the string!

   * When choosing variable names try to adhere to the following
     guidelines.


          vectors : x,y,z,t,w


          matrices : A,B,M


          strings : str,s


          filenames : fname


          cells,cellstrs : c,cstr

   * The documentation string for a variable that is a yes-or-no flag
     should start with words such as "Nonzero means...", to make it
     clear that all nonzero values are equivalent and indicate
     explicitly what zero and nonzero mean.

   * When a function's documentation string mentions the value of an
     argument of the function, use the argument name in capital letters
     as if it were a name for that value.  Thus, the documentation
     string of the operator `/' refers to its second argument as
     `DIVISOR', because the actual argument name is `divisor'.

     Also use all caps for meta-syntactic variables, such as when you
     show the decomposition of a list or vector into subunits, some of
     which may vary.

   Octave also allows extensive formatting of the help string of
functions using Texinfo.  The effect on the online documentation is
relatively small, but makes the help string of functions conform to the
help of Octave's own functions.  However, the effect on the appearance
of printed or online documentation will be greatly improved.

   The fundamental building block of Texinfo documentation strings is
the Texinfo-macro `@deftypefn', which takes three arguments: The class
the function is in, its output arguments, and the function's signature.
Typical classes for functions include `Function File' for standard
Octave functions, and `Loadable Function' for dynamically linked
functions.  A skeletal Texinfo documentation string therefore looks
like this

     -*- texinfo -*-
     @deftypefn{Function File} {@var{ret} =} fn (...)
     @cindex index term
     Help text in Texinfo format.  Code samples should be marked
     like @code{sample of code} and variables should be marked
     as @var{variable}.
     @seealso{fn2}
     @end deftypefn

   This help string must be commented in user functions, or in the help
string of the `DEFUN_DLD' macro for dynamically loadable functions.
The important aspects of the documentation string are

-*- texinfo -*-
     This string signals Octave that the following text is in Texinfo
     format, and should be the first part of any help string in Texinfo
     format.

@deftypefn{class} ... @end deftypefn
     The entire help string should be enclosed within the block defined
     by deftypefn.

@cindex index term
     This generates an index entry, and can be useful when the function
     is included as part of a larger piece of documentation.  It is
     ignored within Octave's help viewer.  Only one index term may
     appear per line but multiple @cindex lines are valid if the
     function should be filed under different terms.

@var{variable}
     All variables should be marked with this macro.  The markup of
     variables is then changed appropriately for display.

@code{sample of code}
     All samples of code should be marked with this macro for the same
     reasons as the @var macro.

@seealso{function2}
     This is a comma separated list of function names that allows cross
     referencing from one function documentation string to another.

   Texinfo format has been designed to generate output for online
viewing with text terminals as well as generating high-quality printed
output.  To these ends, Texinfo has commands which control the
diversion of parts of the document into a particular output processor.
Three formats are of importance: info, HTML and TeX.  These are
selected with

     @ifinfo
     Text area for info only
     @end ifinfo

     @ifhtml
     Text area for HTML only
     @end ifhtml

     @tex
     Text area for TeX only
     @end tex

   Note that often TeX output can be used in HTML documents and so often
the `@ifhtml' blocks are unnecessary.  If no specific output processor
is chosen, by default, the text goes into all output processors.  It is
usual to have the above blocks in pairs to allow the same information
to be conveyed in all output formats, but with a different markup.
Currently, most Octave documentation only makes a distinction between
TeX and all other formats.  Therefore, the following construct is seen
repeatedly.

     @tex
     text for TeX only
     @end tex
     @ifnottex
     text for info, HTML, plaintext
     @end ifnottex

   Another important feature of Texinfo that is often used in Octave
help strings is the `@example' environment.  An example of its use is

     @example
     @group
     @code{2 * 2}
     @result{} 4
     @end group
     @end example

which produces

     `2 * 2'
     => 4

   The `@group' block prevents the example from being split across a
page boundary, while the `@result{}' macro produces a right arrow
signifying the result of a command.  If your example is larger than 20
lines it is better NOT to use grouping so that a reasonable page
boundary can be calculated.

   In many cases a function has multiple ways in which it can be called,
and the `@deftypefnx' macro can be used to give alternatives.  For
example

     -*- texinfo -*-
     @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{a} =} fn (@var{x}, ...)
     @deftypefnx{Function File} {@var{a} =} fn (@var{y}, ...)
     Help text in Texinfo format.
     @end deftypefn

   Many complete examples of Texinfo documentation can be taken from the
help strings for the Octave functions themselves.  A relatively complete
example of which is the `nchoosek' function.  The Texinfo documentation
string for `nchoosek' is

     -*- texinfo -*-
     @deftypefn {Function File} {} nchoosek (@var{n}, @var{k})

     Compute the binomial coefficient or all combinations of
     @var{n}.  If @var{n} is a scalar then, calculate the
     binomial coefficient of @var{n} and @var{k}, defined as

     @tex
     $$
      {n \choose k} = {n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots (n-k+1) \over k!}
     $$
     @end tex
     @ifnottex

     @example
     @group
      /   \
      | n |    n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-k+1)
      |   |  = -------------------------
      | k |               k!
      \   /
     @end group
     @end example
     @end ifnottex

     If @var{n} is a vector, this generates all combinations
     of the elements of @var{n}, taken @var{k} at a time,
     one row per combination.  The resulting @var{c} has size
     @code{[nchoosek (length (@var{n}),@var{k}), @var{k}]}.

     @code{nchoosek} works only for non-negative integer arguments; use
     @code{bincoeff} for non-integer scalar arguments and for using vector
     arguments to compute many coefficients at once.

     @seealso{bincoeff}
     @end deftypefn

   which demonstrates most of the concepts discussed above.

D.1 How to Contribute
=====================

The mailing list for Octave development discussion and sending
contributions is <maintainers@octave.org>.  This concerns the
development of Octave core, i.e., code that goes to Octave directly.
You may consider developing and publishing a package instead; a great
place for this is the allied Octave-Forge project
(`http://octave.sf.net').  Note that the Octave project is inherently
more conservative and follows narrower rules.

   The preferable form of contribution is creating a Mercurial changeset
and sending it via e-mail to the octave-maintainers mailing list.
Mercurial is the source code management system currently used to develop
Octave.  Other forms of contributions (e.g., simple diff patches) are
also acceptable, but they slow down the review process.  If you want to
make more contributions, you should really get familiar with Mercurial.
A good place to start is
`http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Tutorial'.  There you
will also find help how to install Mercurial.

   A simple contribution sequence could look like this:

     hg clone http://www.octave.org/hg/octave
                                  # make a local copy of the octave
                                  # source repository
     cd octave
     # change some sources...
     hg commit -m "make Octave the coolest software ever"
                                  # commit the changeset into your
                                  # local repository
     hg export -o ../cool.diff tip
                                  # export the changeset to a diff
                                  # file
     # send ../cool.diff via email

   You may want to get familiar with Mercurial queues to manage your
changesets. Here is a slightly more complex example using Mercurial
queues, where work on two unrelated changesets is done in parallel and
one of the changesets is updated after discussion on the maintainers
mailing list:

     hg qnew nasty_bug            # create a new patch
     # change sources...
     hg qref                      # save the changes into the patch
     # change even more...
     hg qref -m "solution to nasty bug!"
                                  # save again with commit message
     hg export -o ../nasty.diff tip
                                  # export the patch
     # send ../nasty.diff via email
     hg qpop                      # undo the application of the patch
                                  # and remove the changes from the
                                  # source tree
     hg qnew doc_improvements     # create an unrelated patch
     # change doc sources...
     hg qref -m "could not find myfav.m in the doc"
                                  # save the changes into the patch
     hg export -o ../doc.diff tip
                                  # export the second patch
     # send ../doc.diff tip via email
     hg qpop
     # discussion in the maintainers mailing list ...
     hg qpush nasty_bug           # apply the patch again
     # change sources yet again ...
     hg qref
     hg export -o ../nasty2.diff tip
     # send ../nasty2.diff via email

======================

All Octave's sources are distributed under the General Public License
(GPL).  Currently, Octave uses GPL version 3.  For details about this
license, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html'.  Therefore,
whenever you create a new source file, it should have the following
comment header (use appropriate year, name and comment marks):

     ## Copyright (C) 1996-2011 John W. Eaton <jwe@octave.org>
     ##
     ## This file is part of Octave.

     ## You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
     ## License along with Octave; see the file COPYING.  If not,
     ## see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Always include commit messages in changesets.  After making your
source changes, record and briefly describe the changes in your commit
message.  You should have previously configured your `.hgrc' (or
`Mercurial.ini' on Windows) with your name and email, which will get
automatically added to your commit message.  Your commit message should
have a brief one-line explanation of what the commit does.  If you are
patching a bug, this one-line explanation should mention the bug number
at the end.  If your change is small and only touches one file, this is
typically sufficient.  If you are modifying several files or several
parts of one file, you should enumerate your changes roughly following
the GNU coding standards on changelogs, like the following example:

     look for methods before constructors

     * symtab.cc (symbol_table::fcn_info::fcn_info_rep::find):
     Look for class methods before constructors, contrary to Matlab
     documentation.

     * test/ctor-vs-method: New directory of test classes.
     * test/test_ctor_vs_method.m: New file.
     * test/Makefile.am: Include ctor-vs-method/module.mk.
     (FCN_FILES): Include test_ctor_vs_method.m in the list.

In this example, the names of files is mentioned, and in parentheses the
name of the function in that file that was modified.  There is no need
to mention the function for m-files that only contain one function.  The
commit message should describe what is changed, not why.  Any
explanation of why a change is needed should appear as comments in the
code, particularly if there is something that might not be obvious to
someone reading it later.

   When submitting code which addresses a known bug on the Octave bug
tracker (`http://bugs.octave.org'), please add '(bug #XXXXX)' to the
first line of the commit messages.  For example:

     Fix bug for complex input for gradient (bug #34292).

   The preferred comment mark for places that may need further
attention is FIXME.

D.3 Octave Sources (m-files)
============================

Don't use tabs.  Tabs cause trouble.  If you are used to them, set up
your editor so that it converts tabs to spaces.  Indent the bodies of
the statement blocks.  Recommended indent is 2 spaces.  When calling
functions, put spaces after commas and before the calling parentheses,
like this:

       x = max (sin (y+3), 2);

An exception are matrix and vector constructors:

       [sin(x), cos(x)]

Here, putting spaces after `sin', `cos' would result in a parse error.
In indexing expression, do not put a space after the identifier (this
differentiates indexing and function calls nicely).  The space after
comma is not necessary if index expressions are simple, i.e., you may
write

       A(:,i,j)

but

       A([1:i-1;i+1:n], XI(:,2:n-1))

   Use lowercase names if possible.  Uppercase is acceptable for
variable names consisting of 1-2 letters.  Do not use mixed case names.
Function names must be lowercase.  Function names are global, so choose
them wisely.

   Always use a specific end-of-block statement (like `endif',
`endswitch') rather than generic `end'.

   Enclose the `if', `while', `until' and `switch' conditions in
parentheses, like in C:

     if (isvector (a))
       s = sum(a);
     endif

Do not do this, however, with the iteration counter portion of a `for'
statement.  Write:

     for i = 1:n
       b(i) = sum (a(:,i));
     endfor

D.4 C++ Sources
===============

Don't use tabs.  Tabs cause trouble.  If you are used to them, set up
your editor so that it converts tabs to spaces.  Format function headers
like this:

     static bool
     matches_patterns (const string_vector& patterns, int pat_idx,
                       int num_pat, const std::string& name)

The function name should start in column 1, and multi-line argument
lists should be aligned on the first char after the open parenthesis.
You should put a space after the left open parenthesis and after commas,
for both function definitions and function calls.

   Recommended indent is 2 spaces.  When indenting, indent the statement
after control structures (like `if', `while', etc.).  If there is a
compound statement, indent _both_ the curly braces and the body of the
statement (so that the body gets indented by _two_ indents).  Example:

     if (have_args)
       {
         idx.push_back (first_args);
         have_args = false;
       }
     else
       idx.push_back (make_value_list (*p_args, *p_arg_nm, &tmp));

If you have nested `if' statements, use extra braces for extra
clarification.

   Split long expressions in such a way that a continuation line starts
with an operator rather than identifier.  If the split occurs inside
braces, continuation should be aligned with the first char after the
innermost braces enclosing the split.  Example:

     SVD::type type = ((nargout == 0 || nargout == 1)
                       ? SVD::sigma_only
                       : (nargin == 2) ? SVD::economy : SVD::std);

Consider putting extra braces around a multiline expression to make it
more readable, even if they are not necessary.  Also, do not hesitate to
put extra braces anywhere if it improves clarity.

   Declare variables just before they're needed.  Use local variables of
blocks--it helps optimization.  Don't write multi-line variable
declaration with a single type specification and multiple variables.  If
the variables don't fit on single line, repeat the type specification.
Example:

     octave_value retval;

     octave_idx_type nr = b.rows ();
     octave_idx_type nc = b.cols ();

     double d1, d2;

   Use lowercase names if possible.  Uppercase is acceptable for
variable names consisting of 1-2 letters.  Do not use mixed case names.

   Use Octave's types and classes if possible.  Otherwise, use the C++
standard library.  Use of STL containers and algorithms is encouraged.
Use templates wisely to reduce code duplication.  Avoid comma
expressions, labels and gotos, and explicit typecasts.  If you need to
typecast, use the modern C++ casting operators.  In functions, minimize
the number of `return' statements--use nested `if' statements if
possible.

D.5 Other Sources
=================

Apart from C++ and Octave language (m-files), Octave's sources include
files written in C, Fortran, M4, Perl, Unix shell, AWK, Texinfo and
TeX.  There are not many rules to follow when using these other
languages; some of them are summarized below.  In any case, the golden
rule is: if you modify a source file, try to follow any conventions you
can detect in the file or other similar files.

   For C you should obviously follow all C++ rules that can apply.

   If you modify a Fortran file, you should stay within Fortran 77 with
common extensions like `END DO'.  Currently, we want all sources to be
compilable with the f2c and g77 compilers, without special flags if
possible.  This usually means that non-legacy compilers also accept the
sources.

   The M4 macro language is mainly used for Autoconf configuration
files.  You should follow normal M4 rules when contributing to these
files.  Some M4 files come from external source, namely the Autoconf
archive `http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to'.

   If you give a code example in the documentation written in Texinfo
with the `@example' environment, you should be aware that the text
within such an environment will not be wrapped.  It is recommended that
you keep the lines short enough to fit on pages in the generated pdf or
ps documents.  Here is a ruler (in an `@example' environment) for
finding the appropriate line width:

              1         2         3         4         5         6
     123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

Appendix E Obsolete Functions
*****************************

After being marked as deprecated for two major releases, the following
functions have been removed from Octave.  The third column of the table
shows the version of Octave in which the function was removed.  Prior to
removal, each function in the list was marked as deprecated for at least
two major releases.  All deprecated functions issue warnings explaining
that they will be removed in a future version of Octave, and which
function should be used instead.

   Replacement functions do not always accept precisely the same
arguments as the obsolete function, but should provide equivalent
functionality.

Appendix F Known Causes of Trouble
**********************************

   This section describes known problems that affect users of Octave.
Most of these are not Octave bugs per se--if they were, we would fix
them.  But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

   Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

F.1 Actual Bugs We Haven't Fixed Yet
====================================

   * Output that comes directly from Fortran functions is not sent
     through the pager and may appear out of sequence with other output
     that is sent through the pager.  One way to avoid this is to force
     pending output to be flushed before calling a function that will
     produce output from within Fortran functions.  To do this, use the
     command

          fflush (stdout)

     Another possible workaround is to use the command

          page_screen_output (false);

     to turn the pager off.

   A list of ideas for future enhancements is distributed with Octave.
See the file `PROJECTS' in the top level directory in the source
distribution.

F.2 Reporting Bugs
==================

Your bug reports play an essential role in making Octave reliable.

   When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it
is already known.  *Note Trouble::.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  In any case, the principal function of a bug report is
to help the entire community by making the next version of Octave work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of Octave.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes it possible to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::
* Bug Tracker::        Where to submit your bug report.
* Bug Reporting::      How to report a bug effectively.
* Sending Patches::    How to send a patch for Octave.


File: octave.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Tracker,  Up: Reporting Bugs

F.2.1 Have You Found a Bug?
---------------------------

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If Octave gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
     bug.  Reliable interpreters never crash.

   * If Octave produces incorrect results, for any input whatever, that
     is a bug.

   * Some output may appear to be incorrect when it is in fact due to a
     program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to
     give the desired results on another system.  For example, the
     range operator may produce different results because of
     differences in the way floating point arithmetic is handled on
     various systems.

   * If Octave produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If Octave does not produce an error message for invalid input,
     that is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
     "invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of programs like Octave, your
     suggestions for improvement are welcome in any case.

F.2.2 Where to Report Bugs
--------------------------

To report a bug in Octave, submit a bug report to the Octave bug tracker
`http://bugs.octave.org'.

   *Do not send bug reports to `help-octave'*.  Most users of Octave do
not want to receive bug reports.


File: octave.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Next: Sending Patches,  Prev: Bug Tracker,  Up: Reporting Bugs

F.2.3 How to Report Bugs
------------------------

Submit bug reports for Octave to the Octave bug tracker
`http://bugs.octave.org'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and they conclude that some details don't matter.  Thus, you
might assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does
not matter.  Well, probably it doesn't, but one cannot be sure.
Perhaps the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from
the location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name
were different, the contents of that location would fool the
interpreter into doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe
and give a specific, complete example.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  Always write your bug reports on the
assumption that the bug is not known.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug.  It is better to send a complete
bug report to begin with.

   Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you
for more information, it is best if you include all the previous
information in your response, as well as the information that was
missing.

   To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all
these things:

   * The version of Octave.  You can get this by noting the version
     number that is printed when Octave starts, or running it with the
     `-v' option.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.

     A single statement may not be enough of an example--the bug might
     depend on other details that are missing from the single statement
     where the error finally occurs.

   * The command arguments you gave Octave to execute that example and
     observe the bug.  To guarantee you won't omit something important,
     list all the options.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we would not encounter the bug.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * The command-line arguments you gave to the `configure' command when
     you installed the interpreter.

   * A complete list of any modifications you have made to the
     interpreter source.

     Be precise about these changes--show a context diff for them.

   * Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for
     installing Octave.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "The interpreter gets a fatal signal,"
     or, "The output produced at line 208 is incorrect."

     Of course, if the bug is that the interpreter gets a fatal signal,
     then one can't miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of the interpreter is out of sync, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  Your copy
     might crash and the copy here would not.  If you said to expect a
     crash, then when the interpreter here fails to crash, we would
     know that the bug was not happening.  If you don't say to expect a
     crash, then we would not know whether the bug was happening.  We
     would not be able to draw any conclusion from our observations.

     Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program
     is run.  Unfortunately, this is not enough information unless the
     program is short and simple.  It is very helpful if you can
     include an explanation of the expected output, and why the actual
     output is incorrect.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the Octave source, send them as
     context diffs.  If you even discuss something in the Octave source,
     refer to it by context, not by line number, because the line
     numbers in the development sources probably won't match those in
     your sources.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and
     which changes will not affect it.  Such information is usually not
     necessary to enable us to fix bugs in Octave, but if you can find
     a simpler example to report _instead_ of the original one, that is
     a convenience.  Errors in the output will be easier to spot,
     running under the debugger will take less time, etc.  Most Octave
     bugs involve just one function, so the most straightforward way to
     simplify an example is to delete all the function definitions
     except the one in which the bug occurs.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you don't want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.

   * A patch for the bug.  Patches can be helpful, but if you find a
     bug, you should report it, even if you cannot send a fix for the
     problem.

F.2.4 Sending Patches for Octave
--------------------------------

If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for Octave, that is
very helpful.  When you send your changes, please follow these
guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying the patches.

   If you don't follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining Octave is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep up unless you do
your best to help.

   * Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or
     what improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a
     copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

   * Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you
     have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is
     right before installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have
     trouble judging it if we don't have a way to reproduce the problem.

   * Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people
     reading the source in the future understand why this change was
     needed.

   * Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
     _individually_.

     If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not
     want to install them both.  We might want to install just one.

   * Use `diff -c' to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
     for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for
     us to study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.
     Unified diff format is better than contextless diffs, but not as
     easy to read as `-c' format.

     If you have GNU diff, use `diff -cp', which shows the name of the
     function that each change occurs in.

   * Write the change log entries for your changes.

     Read the `ChangeLog' file to see what sorts of information to put
     in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change
     log is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need
     to be specific about what functions you changed; in large
     functions, it's often helpful to indicate where within the
     function the change was made.

     On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the
     change, you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new
     function, all you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you
     feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does--but the
     explanation will be much more useful if you put it in comments in
     the code.

     If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who
     made the change, send us the header line.

F.3 How To Get Help with Octave
===============================

The mailing list <help@octave.org> exists for the discussion of matters
related to using and installing Octave.  If would like to join the
discussion, please send a short note to <help-request@octave.org>.

   *Please do not* send requests to be added or removed from the
mailing list, or other administrative trivia to the list itself.

   If you think you have found a bug in Octave or in the installation
procedure, however, you should submit a complete bug report to the
Octave bug tracker at `http://bugs.octave.org'.  But before you submit
a bug report, please read `http://www.octave.org/bugs.html' to learn
how to submit a useful bug report.

Appendix G Installing Octave
****************************

   The procedure for installing Octave from source on a Unix-like
system is described below.  Building on other platforms will follow
similar steps.

   * Run the shell script `configure'.  This will determine the features
     your system has (or doesn't have) and create a file named
     `Makefile' from each of the files named `Makefile.in'.

     Here is a summary of the configure options that are most
     frequently used when building Octave:

    `--help'
          Print a summary of the options recognized by the configure
          script.

    `--prefix=PREFIX'
          Install Octave in subdirectories below PREFIX.  The default
          value of PREFIX is `/usr/local'.

    `--srcdir=DIR'
          Look for Octave sources in the directory DIR.

    `--enable-64'
          This is an *experimental* option to enable Octave to use
          64-bit integers for array dimensions and indexing on 64-bit
          platforms.  You probably don't want to use this option unless
          you know what you are doing.  *Note Compiling Octave with
          64-bit Indexing::, for more details about building Octave
          with this option.

    `--enable-bounds-check'
          Enable bounds checking for indexing operators in the internal
          array classes.  This option is primarily used for debugging
          Octave.  Building Octave with this option has a negative
          impact on performance and is not recommended for general use.

    `--disable-docs'
          Disable building all forms of the documentation (Info, PDF,
          HTML).  The default is to build documentation, but your
          system will need functioning Texinfo and Tex installs for
          this to succeed.

    `--enable-float-truncate'
          This option allows for truncation of intermediate floating
          point results in calculations.  It is only necessary for
          certain platforms.

    `--enable-readline'
          Use the readline library to provide for editing of the
          command line in terminal environments.  This option is on by
          default.

    `--enable-shared'
          Create shared libraries (this is the default).  If you are
          planning to use the dynamic loading features, you will
          probably want to use this option.  It will make your `.oct'
          files much smaller and on some systems it may be necessary to
          build shared libraries in order to use dynamically linked
          functions.

          You may also want to build a shared version of `libstdc++',
          if your system doesn't already have one.

    `--enable-dl'
          Use `dlopen' and friends to make Octave capable of dynamically
          linking externally compiled functions (this is the default if
          `--enable-shared' is specified).  This option only works on
          systems that actually have these functions.  If you plan on
          using this feature, you should probably also use
          `--enable-shared' to reduce the size of your `.oct' files.

    `--with-blas=<lib>'
          By default, configure looks for the best BLAS matrix
          libraries on your system, including optimized implementations
          such as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned
          libraries.  (The use of an optimized BLAS will generally
          result in several-times faster matrix operations.)  Use this
          option to specify a particular BLAS library that Octave
          should use.

    `--with-lapack=<lib>'
          By default, configure looks for the best LAPACK matrix
          libraries on your system, including optimized implementations
          such as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned
          libraries.  (The use of an optimized LAPACK will generally
          result in several-times faster matrix operations.)  Use this
          option to specify a particular LAPACK library that Octave
          should use.

    `--with-magick=<lib>'
          Select the library to use for image I/O.  The two possible
          values are "GraphicsMagick" (default) or "ImageMagick".

    `--with-sepchar=<char>'
          Use <char> as the path separation character.  This option can
          help when running Octave on non-Unix systems.

    `--without-amd'
          Don't use AMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-camd'
          Don't use CAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-colamd'
          Don't use COLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-ccolamd'
          Don't use CCOLAMD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-cholmod'
          Don't use CHOLMOD, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-curl'
          Don't use the cURL library, disable the ftp objects,
          `urlread' and `urlwrite' functions.

    `--without-cxsparse'
          Don't use CXSPARSE, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-fftw3'
          Use the included FFTPACK library for computing Fast Fourier
          Transforms instead of the FFTW3 library.

    `--without-fftw3f'
          Use the included FFTPACK library for computing Fast Fourier
          Transforms instead of the FFTW3 library when operating on
          single precision (float) values.

    `--without-glpk'
          Don't use the GLPK library for linear programming.

    `--without-hdf5'
          Don't use the HDF5 library, disable reading and writing of
          HDF5 files.

    `--without-opengl'
          Don't use OpenGL, disable native graphics toolkit for
          plotting.  You will need `gnuplot' installed in order to make
          plots.

    `--without-qhull'
          Don't use Qhull, disable `delaunay', `convhull', and related
          functions.

    `--without-qrupdate'
          Don't use QRUPDATE, disable QR and Cholesky update functions.

    `--without-umfpack'
          Don't use UMFPACK, disable some sparse matrix functionality.

    `--without-zlib'
          Don't use the zlib library, disable data file compression and
          support for recent MAT file formats.

    `--without-framework-carbon'
          Don't use framework Carbon headers, libraries, or specific
          source code even if the configure test succeeds (the default
          is to use Carbon framework if available).  This is a platform
          specific configure option for Mac systems.

    `--without-framework-opengl'
          Don't use framework OpenGL headers, libraries, or specific
          source code even if the configure test succeeds.  If this
          option is given then OpenGL headers and libraries in standard
          system locations are tested (the default value is
          `--with-framework-opengl').  This is a platform specific
          configure option for Mac systems.


     See the file `INSTALL' for more general information about the
     command line options used by configure.  That file also contains
     instructions for compiling in a directory other than the one where
     the source is located.

   * Run make.

     You will need a recent version of GNU Make as Octave relies on
     certain features not generally available in all versions of make.
     Modifying Octave's makefiles to work with other make programs is
     probably not worth your time; instead, we simply recommend
     installing GNU Make.

     There are currently two options for plotting in Octave: (1) the
     external program gnuplot, or (2) the internal graphics engine
     using OpenGL and FLTK.  Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive
     function plotting program.  Gnuplot is copyrighted, but freely
     distributable.  As of Octave release 3.4, gnuplot is the default
     option for plotting.  But, the internal graphics engine is nearly
     100% compatible, certainly for most ordinary plots, and users are
     encouraged to test it.  It is anticipated that the internal engine
     will become the default option at the next major release of Octave.

     To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of `g++' or other
     ANSI C++ compiler.  In addition, you will need a Fortran 77
     compiler or `f2c'.  If you use `f2c', you will need a script like
     `fort77' that works like a normal Fortran compiler by combining
     `f2c' with your C compiler in a single script.

     If you plan to modify the parser you will also need GNU `bison' and
     `flex'.  If you modify the documentation, you will need GNU
     Texinfo.

     GNU Make, `gcc' (and `libstdc++'), `gnuplot', `bison', `flex', and
     Texinfo are all available from many anonymous ftp archives.  The
     primary site is `ftp.gnu.org', but it is often very busy.  A list
     of sites that mirror the software on `ftp.gnu.org' is available by
     anonymous ftp from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'.

     Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
     compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don't
     compile with debugging symbols).  To compile without debugging
     symbols try the command

          make CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=

     instead of just `make'.

   * If you encounter errors while compiling Octave, first check the
     list of known problems below to see if there is a workaround or
     solution for your problem.  If not, see *note Trouble::, for
     information about how to report bugs.

   * Once you have successfully compiled Octave, run `make install'.

     This will install a copy of Octave, its libraries, and its
     documentation in the destination directory.  As distributed,
     Octave is installed in the following directories.  In the table
     below, PREFIX defaults to `/usr/local', VERSION stands for the
     current version number of the interpreter, and ARCH is the type of
     computer on which Octave is installed (for example,
     `i586-unknown-gnu').

    `PREFIX/bin'
          Octave and other binaries that people will want to run
          directly.

    `PREFIX/lib/octave-VERSION'
          Libraries like libcruft.a and liboctave.a.

    `PREFIX/octave-VERSION/include/octave'
          Include files distributed with Octave.

    `PREFIX/share'
          Architecture-independent data files.

    `PREFIX/share/man/man1'
          Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

    `PREFIX/share/info'
          Info files describing Octave.

    `PREFIX/share/octave/VERSION/m'
          Function files distributed with Octave.  This includes the
          Octave version, so that multiple versions of Octave may be
          installed at the same time.

    `PREFIX/libexec/octave/VERSION/exec/ARCH'
          Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

    `PREFIX/lib/octave/VERSION/oct/ARCH'
          Object files that will be dynamically loaded.

    `PREFIX/share/octave/VERSION/imagelib'
          Image files that are distributed with Octave.

G.1 Compiling Octave with 64-bit Indexing
=========================================

Note: the following only applies to systems that have 64-bit pointers.
Configuring Octave with `--enable-64' cannot magically make a 32-bit
system have a 64-bit address space.

   On 64-bit systems, Octave is limited to (approximately) the following
array sizes when using the default 32-bit indexing mode:

     double:         16GB
     single:          8GB
     uint64, int64:  16GB
     uint32, int32:   8GB
     uint16, int16:   4GB
     uint8, int8:     2GB

   In each case, the limit is really (approximately) 2^31 elements
because of the default type of the value used for indexing arrays
(signed 32-bit integer, corresponding to the size of a Fortran INTEGER
value).

   Trying to create larger arrays will produce the following error:

     octave:1> a = zeros (1024*1024*1024*3, 1, 'int8');
     error: memory exhausted or requested size too large
            for range of Octave's index type --
            trying to return to prompt

You will obtain this error even if your system has enough memory to
create this array (4 GB in the above case).

   To use arrays larger than 2 GB, Octave has to be configured with the
option `--enable-64'.  This option is experimental and you are
encouraged to submit bug reports if you find a problem.  With this
option, Octave will use 64-bit integers internally for array dimensions
and indexing.  However, all numerical libraries used by Octave will
*also* need to use 64-bit integers for array dimensions and indexing.
In most cases, this means they will need to be compiled from source
since most (all?) distributions which package these libraries compile
them with the default Fortran integer size, which is normally 32-bits
wide.

   The following instructions were tested with the development version
of Octave and GCC 4.3.4 on an x86_64 Debian system.

   The versions listed below are the versions used for testing.  If
newer versions of these packages are available, you should try to use
them, although there may be some differences.

   All libraries and header files will be installed in subdirectories of
`$prefix64' (you must choose the location of this directory).

   * BLAS and LAPACK (`http://www.netlib.org/lapack')

     Reference versions for both libraries are included in the reference
     LAPACK 3.2.1 distribution from `netlib.org'.

        - Copy the file `make.inc.example' and name it `make.inc'.  The
          options `-fdefault-integer-8' and `-fPIC' (on 64-bit CPU)
          have to be added to the variable `OPTS' and `NOOPT'.

        - Once you have compiled this library make sure that you use it
          for compiling Suite Sparse and Octave.  In the following we
          assume that you installed the LAPACK library as
          $prefix64/lib/liblapack.a.

   * QRUPDATE (`http://sourceforge.net/projects/qrupdate')

     In the `Makeconf' file:

        - Add `-fdefault-integer-8' to `FFLAGS'.

        - Adjust the BLAS and LAPACK variables as needed if your 64-bit
          aware BLAS and LAPACK libraries are in a non-standard
          location.

        - Set `PREFIX' to the top-level directory of your install tree.

        - Run `make solib' to make a shared library.

        - Run `make install' to install the library.

   * SuiteSparse (`http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse')

        - In `UFconfig/UFconfig.mk' use the following options for
          `CFLAGS' and `F77FLAGS':

               CC = gcc
               CFLAGS = -fPIC -O -DLP64 -DLONGBLAS='long int' -DLONG='long int'
               F77 = gfortran
               F77FLAGS = -fPIC -O -fdefault-integer-8
               BLAS = -L$BLAS/lib -lblas -lgfortran"
               LAPACK = -L$LAPACK/lib -llapack"

        - Disable the GPL-incompatible `METIS' library:

               CHOLMOD_CONFIG = -DNPARTITION
               SPQR_CONFIG = -DNPARTITION
               METIS_PATH =
               METIS =

        - Disable the `DI' versions of the `CHOLMOD' library files by
          setting

               OBJ = $(DL)

          in `CHOLMOD/Lib/Makefile'.

        - Disable the `DI' versions of the `CHOLMOD' tests by commenting
          out or deleting the following lines in
          `CHOLMOD/Demo/Makefile':

               ./cholmod_demo < Matrix/bcsstk01.tri
               ./cholmod_demo < Matrix/lp_afiro.tri
               ./cholmod_demo < Matrix/can___24.mtx
               ./cholmod_demo < Matrix/c.tri
               ./cholmod_simple < Matrix/c.tri
               ./cholmod_simple < Matrix/can___24.mtx
               ./cholmod_simple < Matrix/bcsstk01.tri

        - Run `make' to build the libraries.

        - The SuiteSparse `Makefile' does not have an install target so
          you must install the files by hand:

               mkdir $prefix64/include/suitesparse
               cp UFconfig/UFconfig.h $prefix64/include/suitesparse
               for d in AMD BTF CAMD CCOLAMD \
                        CHOLMOD COLAMD CXSparse UMFPACK; do
                 cp $d/Lib/lib*a $prefix64/lib
                 cp $d/Include/*h $prefix64/include/suitesparse
               done

        - You can generate shared versions of these libraries by doing
          the following in the `$prefix64/lib' directory:

               top=$(pwd)
               for f in *.a; do
                 mkdir tmp
                 cd tmp
                 ar vx ../$f
                 gcc -shared -o ../${f%%.a}.so *.o
                 cd $top
                 rm -rf tmp
               done


   * ATLAS instead of reference BLAS and LAPACK

     Suggestions on how to compile ATLAS would be most welcome.

   * GLPK

     Suggestions on how to compile GLPK would be most welcome.

   * Qhull (`http://www.qhull.org')

     Suggestions on how to compile Qhull would be most welcome.

   * Octave

     Octave's 64-bit index support is activated with the configure
     option `--enable-64'.

          ./configure \
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix64/lib" \
            CPPFLAGS="-I$prefix64/include" LDFLAGS="-L$prefix64/lib" \
            --enable-64

     You must ensure that all Fortran sources except those in the
     `libcruft/ranlib' directory are compiled such that INTEGERS are
     8-bytes wide.  If you are using gfortan, the configure script
     should automatically set the Makefile variable
     `F77_INTEGER_8_FLAG' to `-fdefault-integer-8'.  If you are using
     another compiler, you must set this variable yourself.  You should
     NOT set this flag in `FFLAGS', otherwise the files in
     `libcruft/ranlib' will be miscompiled.

   * Other dependencies

     Probably nothing special needs to be done for the following
     dependencies.  If you discover that something does need to be done,
     please submit a bug report.

        - pcre

        - zlib

        - hdf5

        - fftw3

        - cURL

        - GraphicsMagick++

        - OpenGL

        - freetype

        - fontconfig

        - fltk

G.2 Installation Problems
=========================

This section contains a list of problems (and some apparent problems
that don't really mean anything is wrong) that may show up during
installation of Octave.

   * On some SCO systems, `info' fails to compile if `HAVE_TERMIOS_H'
     is defined in `config.h'.  Simply removing the definition from
     `info/config.h' should allow it to compile.

   * If `configure' finds `dlopen', `dlsym', `dlclose', and `dlerror',
     but not the header file `dlfcn.h', you need to find the source for
     the header file and install it in the directory `usr/include'.
     This is reportedly a problem with Slackware 3.1.  For Linux/GNU
     systems, the source for `dlfcn.h' is in the `ldso' package.

   * Building `.oct' files doesn't work.

     You should probably have a shared version of `libstdc++'.  A patch
     is needed to build shared versions of version 2.7.2 of `libstdc++'
     on the HP-PA architecture.  You can find the patch at
     `ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/libg++-2.7.2-hppa-gcc-fix'.

   * On some DEC alpha systems there may be a problem with the `libdxml'
     library, resulting in floating point errors and/or segmentation
     faults in the linear algebra routines called by Octave.  If you
     encounter such problems, then you should modify the configure
     script so that `SPECIAL_MATH_LIB' is not set to `-ldxml'.

   * On FreeBSD systems Octave may hang while initializing some internal
     constants.  The fix appears to be to use

          options      GPL_MATH_EMULATE

     rather than

          options      MATH_EMULATE

     in the kernel configuration files (typically found in the directory
     `/sys/i386/conf'.  After making this change, you'll need to rebuild
     the kernel, install it, and reboot.

   * If you encounter errors like

          passing `void (*)()' as argument 2 of
            `octave_set_signal_handler(int, void (*)(int))'

     or

          warning: ANSI C++ prohibits conversion from `(int)'
                   to `(...)'

     while compiling `sighandlers.cc', you may need to edit some files
     in the `gcc' include subdirectory to add proper prototypes for
     functions there.  For example, Ultrix 4.2 needs proper
     declarations for the `signal' function and the `SIG_IGN' macro in
     the file `signal.h'.

     On some systems the `SIG_IGN' macro is defined to be something
     like this:

          #define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)())1

     when it should really be something like:

          #define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)(int))1

     to match the prototype declaration for the `signal' function.  This
     change should also be made for the `SIG_DFL' and `SIG_ERR'
     symbols.  It may be necessary to change the definitions in
     `sys/signal.h' as well.

     The `gcc' `fixincludes' and `fixproto' scripts should probably fix
     these problems when `gcc' installs its modified set of header
     files, but I don't think that's been done yet.

     *You should not change the files in `/usr/include'*.  You can find
     the `gcc' include directory tree by running the command

          gcc -print-libgcc-file-name

     The directory of `gcc' include files normally begins in the same
     directory that contains the file `libgcc.a'.

   * Some of the Fortran subroutines may fail to compile with older
     versions of the Sun Fortran compiler.  If you get errors like

          zgemm.f:
                  zgemm:
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 245: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 304: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
          zgemm.f, line 327: warning: unexpected parent of complex
            expression subtree
          pcc_binval: missing IR_CONV in complex op
          make[2]: *** [zgemm.o] Error 1

     when compiling the Fortran subroutines in the `libcruft'
     subdirectory, you should either upgrade your compiler or try
     compiling with optimization turned off.

   * On NeXT systems, if you get errors like this:

          /usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local
                symbol LBB7656
          /usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local
                symbol LBE7656

     when compiling `Array.cc' and `Matrix.cc', try recompiling these
     files without `-g'.

   * Some people have reported that calls to shell_cmd and the pager do
     not work on SunOS systems.  This is apparently due to having
     `G_HAVE_SYS_WAIT' defined to be 0 instead of 1 when compiling
     `libg++'.

   * On NeXT systems, linking to `libsys_s.a' may fail to resolve the
     following functions

          _tcgetattr
          _tcsetattr
          _tcflow

     which are part of `libposix.a'.  Unfortunately, linking Octave with
     `-posix' results in the following undefined symbols.

          .destructors_used
          .constructors_used
          _objc_msgSend
          _NXGetDefaultValue
          _NXRegisterDefaults
          .objc_class_name_NXStringTable
          .objc_class_name_NXBundle

     One kluge around this problem is to extract `termios.o' from
     `libposix.a', put it in Octave's `src' directory, and add it to
     the list of files to link together in the makefile.  Suggestions
     for better ways to solve this problem are welcome!

   * If Octave crashes immediately with a floating point exception, it
     is likely that it is failing to initialize the IEEE floating point
     values for infinity and NaN.

     If your system actually does support IEEE arithmetic, you should
     be able to fix this problem by modifying the function
     `octave_ieee_init' in the file `lo-ieee.cc' to correctly
     initialize Octave's internal infinity and NaN variables.

     If your system does not support IEEE arithmetic but Octave's
     configure script incorrectly determined that it does, you can work
     around the problem by editing the file `config.h' to not define
     `HAVE_ISINF', `HAVE_FINITE', and `HAVE_ISNAN'.

     In any case, please report this as a bug since it might be
     possible to modify Octave's configuration script to automatically
     determine the proper thing to do.

   * If Octave is unable to find a header file because it is installed
     in a location that is not normally searched by the compiler, you
     can add the directory to the include search path by specifying
     (for example) `CPPFLAGS=-I/some/nonstandard/directory' as an
     argument to `configure'.  Other variables that can be specified
     this way are `CFLAGS', `CXXFLAGS', `FFLAGS', and `LDFLAGS'.
     Passing them as options to the configure script also records them
     in the `config.status' file.  By default, `CPPFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS'
     are empty, `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS' are set to `"-g -O"' and
     `FFLAGS' is set to `"-O"'.

Appendix H Emacs Octave Support
*******************************

The development of Octave code can greatly be facilitated using Emacs
with Octave mode, a major mode for editing Octave files which can e.g.
automatically indent the code, do some of the typing (with Abbrev mode)
and show keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font-lock mode on devices that support it).

   It is also possible to run Octave from within Emacs, either by
directly entering commands at the prompt in a buffer in Inferior Octave
mode, or by interacting with Octave from within a file with Octave
code.  This is useful in particular for debugging Octave code.

   Finally, you can convince Octave to use the Emacs info reader for
`help -i'.

   All functionality is provided by the Emacs Lisp package EOS (for
"Emacs Octave Support").  This chapter describes how to set up and use
this package.

   Please contact <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> if you have any questions
or suggestions on using EOS.

H.1 Installing EOS
==================

The Emacs package EOS consists of the three files `octave-mod.el',
`octave-inf.el', and `octave-hlp.el'.  These files, or better yet their
byte-compiled versions, should be somewhere in your Emacs load-path.

   If you have GNU Emacs with a version number at least as high as
19.35, you are all set up, because EOS is respectively will be part of
GNU Emacs as of version 19.35.

   Otherwise, copy the three files from the `emacs' subdirectory of the
Octave distribution to a place where Emacs can find them (this depends
on how your Emacs was installed).  Byte-compile them for speed if you
want.

H.2 Using Octave Mode
=====================

If you are lucky, your sysadmins have already arranged everything so
that Emacs automatically goes into Octave mode whenever you visit an
Octave code file as characterized by its extension `.m'.  If not,
proceed as follows.

  1. To begin using Octave mode for all `.m' files you visit, add the
     following lines to a file loaded by Emacs at startup time,
     typically your `~/.emacs' file:

          (autoload 'octave-mode "octave-mod" nil t)
          (setq auto-mode-alist
                (cons '("\\.m$" . octave-mode) auto-mode-alist))

  2. Finally, to turn on the abbrevs, auto-fill and font-lock features
     automatically, also add the following lines to one of the Emacs
     startup files:
          (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (abbrev-mode 1)
                      (auto-fill-mode 1)
                      (if (eq window-system 'x)
                          (font-lock-mode 1))))
     See the Emacs manual for more information about how to customize
     Font-lock mode.

   In Octave mode, the following special Emacs commands can be used in
addition to the standard Emacs commands.

`C-h m'
     Describe the features of Octave mode.

`LFD'
     Reindent the current Octave line, insert a newline and indent the
     new line (`octave-reindent-then-newline-and-indent').  An abbrev
     before point is expanded if `abbrev-mode' is non-`nil'.

`TAB'
     Indents current Octave line based on its contents and on previous
     lines (`indent-according-to-mode').

`;'
     Insert an "electric" semicolon (`octave-electric-semi').  If
     `octave-auto-indent' is non-`nil', reindent the current line.  If
     `octave-auto-newline' is non-`nil', automagically insert a newline
     and indent the new line.

``'
     Start entering an abbreviation (`octave-abbrev-start').  If Abbrev
     mode is turned on, typing ``C-h' or ``?' lists all abbrevs.  Any
     other key combination is executed normally.  Note that all Octave
     abbrevs start with a grave accent.

`M-LFD'
     Break line at point and insert continuation marker and alignment
     (`octave-split-line').

`M-TAB'
     Perform completion on Octave symbol preceding point, comparing that
     symbol against Octave's reserved words and built-in variables
     (`octave-complete-symbol').

`M-C-a'
     Move backward to the beginning of a function
     (`octave-beginning-of-defun').  With prefix argument N, do it that
     many times if N is positive; otherwise, move forward to the N-th
     following beginning of a function.

`M-C-e'
     Move forward to the end of a function (`octave-end-of-defun').
     With prefix argument N, do it that many times if N is positive;
     otherwise, move back to the N-th preceding end of a function.

`M-C-h'
     Puts point at beginning and mark at the end of the current Octave
     function, i.e., the one containing point or following point
     (`octave-mark-defun').

`M-C-q'
     Properly indents the Octave function which contains point
     (`octave-indent-defun').

`M-;'
     If there is no comment already on this line, create a code-level
     comment (started by two comment characters) if the line is empty,
     or an in-line comment (started by one comment character) otherwise
     (`octave-indent-for-comment').  Point is left after the start of
     the comment which is properly aligned.

`C-c ;'
     Puts the comment character `#' (more precisely, the string value of
     `octave-comment-start') at the beginning of every line in the
     region (`octave-comment-region').  With just `C-u' prefix
     argument, uncomment each line in the region.  A numeric prefix
     argument N means use N comment characters.

`C-c :'
     Uncomments every line in the region (`octave-uncomment-region').

`C-c C-p'
     Move one line of Octave code backward, skipping empty and comment
     lines (`octave-previous-code-line').  With numeric prefix argument
     N, move that many code lines backward (forward if N is negative).

`C-c C-n'
     Move one line of Octave code forward, skipping empty and comment
     lines (`octave-next-code-line').  With numeric prefix argument N,
     move that many code lines forward (backward if N is negative).

`C-c C-a'
     Move to the `real' beginning of the current line
     (`octave-beginning-of-line').  If point is in an empty or comment
     line, simply go to its beginning; otherwise, move backwards to the
     beginning of the first code line which is not inside a continuation
     statement, i.e., which does not follow a code line ending in `...'
     or `\', or is inside an open parenthesis list.

`C-c C-e'
     Move to the `real' end of the current line (`octave-end-of-line').
     If point is in a code line, move forward to the end of the first
     Octave code line which does not end in `...' or `\' or is inside an
     open parenthesis list.  Otherwise, simply go to the end of the
     current line.

`C-c M-C-n'
     Move forward across one balanced begin-end block of Octave code
     (`octave-forward-block').  With numeric prefix argument N, move
     forward across N such blocks (backward if N is negative).

`C-c M-C-p'
     Move back across one balanced begin-end block of Octave code
     (`octave-backward-block').  With numeric prefix argument N, move
     backward across N such blocks (forward if N is negative).

`C-c M-C-d'
     Move forward down one begin-end block level of Octave code
     (`octave-down-block').  With numeric prefix argument, do it that
     many times; a negative argument means move backward, but still go
     down one level.

`C-c M-C-u'
     Move backward out of one begin-end block level of Octave code
     (`octave-backward-up-block').  With numeric prefix argument, do it
     that many times; a negative argument means move forward, but still
     to a less deep spot.

`C-c M-C-h'
     Put point at the beginning of this block, mark at the end
     (`octave-mark-block').  The block marked is the one that contains
     point or follows point.

`C-c ]'
     Close the current block on a separate line (`octave-close-block').
     An error is signaled if no block to close is found.

`C-c f'
     Insert a function skeleton, prompting for the function's name,
     arguments and return values which have to be entered without
     parentheses (`octave-insert-defun').

`C-c C-h'
     Search the function, operator and variable indices of all info
     files with documentation for Octave for entries (`octave-help').
     If used interactively, the entry is prompted for with completion.
     If multiple matches are found, one can cycle through them using
     the standard `,' (`Info-index-next') command of the Info reader.

     The variable `octave-help-files' is a list of files to search
     through and defaults to `'("octave")'.  If there is also an Octave
     Local Guide with corresponding info file, say, `octave-LG', you can
     have `octave-help' search both files by
          (setq octave-help-files '("octave" "octave-LG"))
     in one of your Emacs startup files.


   A common problem is that the <RET> key does _not_ indent the line to
where the new text should go after inserting the newline.  This is
because the standard Emacs convention is that <RET> (aka `C-m') just
adds a newline, whereas <LFD> (aka `C-j') adds a newline and indents
it.  This is particularly inconvenient for users with keyboards which
do not have a special <LFD> key at all; in such cases, it is typically
more convenient to use <RET> as the <LFD> key (rather than typing
`C-j').

   You can make <RET> do this by adding
     (define-key octave-mode-map "\C-m"
       'octave-reindent-then-newline-and-indent)
   to one of your Emacs startup files.  Another, more generally
applicable solution is
     (defun RET-behaves-as-LFD ()
       (let ((x (key-binding "\C-j")))
         (local-set-key "\C-m" x)))
     (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook 'RET-behaves-as-LFD)
   (this works for all modes by adding to the startup hooks, without
having to know the particular binding of <RET> in that mode!).  Similar
considerations apply for using <M-RET> as <M-LFD>.  As Barry A. Warsaw
<bwarsaw@cnri.reston.va.us> says in the documentation for his
`cc-mode', "This is a very common question.  `:-)' If you want this to
be the default behavior, don't lobby me, lobby RMS!"

   The following variables can be used to customize Octave mode.

`octave-auto-indent'
     Non-`nil' means auto-indent the current line after a semicolon or
     space.  Default is `nil'.

`octave-auto-newline'
     Non-`nil' means auto-insert a newline and indent after semicolons
     are typed.  The default value is `nil'.

`octave-blink-matching-block'
     Non-`nil' means show matching begin of block when inserting a
     space, newline or `;' after an else or end keyword.  Default is
     `t'.  This is an extremely useful feature for automatically
     verifying that the keywords match--if they don't, an error message
     is displayed.

`octave-block-offset'
     Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
     Default is 2.

`octave-continuation-offset'
     Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.  Default
     is 4.

`octave-continuation-string'
     String used for Octave continuation lines.  Normally `\'.

`octave-mode-startup-message'
     If `t' (default), a startup message is displayed when Octave mode
     is called.


   If Font Lock mode is enabled, Octave mode will display
   * strings in `font-lock-string-face'

   * comments in `font-lock-comment-face'

   * the Octave reserved words (such as all block keywords) and the text
     functions (such as `cd' or `who') which are also reserved using
     `font-lock-keyword-face'

   * the built-in operators (`&&', `==', ...) using
     `font-lock-reference-face'

   * and the function names in function declarations in
     `font-lock-function-name-face'.

   There is also rudimentary support for Imenu (currently, function
names can be indexed).

   You can generate TAGS files for Emacs from Octave `.m' files using
the shell script `octave-tags' that is installed alongside your copy of
Octave.

   Customization of Octave mode can be performed by modification of the
variable `octave-mode-hook'.  If the value of this variable is
non-`nil', turning on Octave mode calls its value.

   If you discover a problem with Octave mode, you can conveniently
send a bug report using `C-c C-b' (`octave-submit-bug-report').  This
automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information already
added.  You just need to add a description of the problem, including a
reproducible test case and send the message.

H.3 Running Octave from Within Emacs
====================================

The package `octave' provides commands for running an inferior Octave
process in a special Emacs buffer.  Use
     M-x run-octave
   to directly start an inferior Octave process.  If Emacs does not know
about this command, add the line
     (autoload 'run-octave "octave-inf" nil t)
   to your `.emacs' file.

   This will start Octave in a special buffer the name of which is
specified by the variable `inferior-octave-buffer' and defaults to
`"*Inferior Octave*"'.  From within this buffer, you can interact with
the inferior Octave process `as usual', i.e., by entering Octave
commands at the prompt.  The buffer is in Inferior Octave mode, which
is derived from the standard Comint mode, a major mode for interacting
with an inferior interpreter.  See the documentation for `comint-mode'
for more details, and use `C-h b' to find out about available special
keybindings.

   You can also communicate with an inferior Octave process from within
files with Octave code (i.e., buffers in Octave mode), using the
following commands.

`C-c i l'
     Send the current line to the inferior Octave process
     (`octave-send-line').  With positive prefix argument N, send that
     many lines.  If `octave-send-line-auto-forward' is non-`nil', go
     to the next unsent code line.

`C-c i b'
     Send the current block to the inferior Octave process
     (`octave-send-block').

`C-c i f'
     Send the current function to the inferior Octave process
     (`octave-send-defun').

`C-c i r'
     Send the region to the inferior Octave process
     (`octave-send-region').

`C-c i s'
     Make sure that `inferior-octave-buffer' is displayed
     (`octave-show-process-buffer').

`C-c i h'
     Delete all windows that display the inferior Octave buffer
     (`octave-hide-process-buffer').

`C-c i k'
     Kill the inferior Octave process and its buffer
     (`octave-kill-process').

   The effect of the commands which send code to the Octave process can
be customized by the following variables.
`octave-send-echo-input'
     Non-`nil' means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.
     Default is `t'.

`octave-send-show-buffer'
     Non-`nil' means display the buffer running the Octave process after
     sending a command (but without selecting it).  Default is `t'.

   If you send code and there is no inferior Octave process yet, it
will be started automatically.

   The startup of the inferior Octave process is highly customizable.
The variable `inferior-octave-startup-args' can be used for specifying
command lines arguments to be passed to Octave on startup as a list of
strings.  For example, to suppress the startup message and use
`traditional' mode, set this to `'("-q" "--traditional")'.  You can
also specify a startup file of Octave commands to be loaded on startup;
note that these commands will not produce any visible output in the
process buffer.  Which file to use is controlled by the variable
`inferior-octave-startup-file'.  If this is `nil', the file
`~/.emacs-octave' is used if it exists.

   And finally, `inferior-octave-mode-hook' is run after starting the
process and putting its buffer into Inferior Octave mode.  Hence, if you
like the up and down arrow keys to behave in the interaction buffer as
in the shell, and you want this buffer to use nice colors, add
     (add-hook 'inferior-octave-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (turn-on-font-lock)
                 (define-key inferior-octave-mode-map [up]
                   'comint-previous-input)
                 (define-key inferior-octave-mode-map [down]
                   'comint-next-input)))
   to your `.emacs' file.  You could also swap the roles of `C-a'
(`beginning-of-line') and `C-c C-a' (`comint-bol') using this hook.

     *Note* that if you set your Octave prompts to something different
     from the defaults, make sure that `inferior-octave-prompt' matches
     them.  Otherwise, _nothing_ will work, because Emacs will not know
     when Octave is waiting for input, or done sending output.


File: octave.info,  Node: Using the Emacs Info Reader for Octave,  Prev: Running Octave from Within Emacs,  Up: Emacs Octave Support

H.4 Using the Emacs Info Reader for Octave
==========================================

You may also use the Emacs Info reader with Octave's `doc' function.
For this, the package `gnuserv' needs to be installed.

   If `gnuserv' is installed, add the lines
     (autoload 'octave-help "octave-hlp" nil t)
     (require 'gnuserv)
     (gnuserv-start)
   to your `.emacs' file.

   You can use either `plain' Emacs Info or the function `octave-help'
as your Octave info reader (for `help -i').  In the former case, use
`info_program ("info-emacs-info")'.  The latter is perhaps more
attractive because it allows to look up keys in the indices of
_several_ info files related to Octave (provided that the Emacs
variable `octave-help-files' is set correctly).  In this case, use
`info_program ("info-emacs-octave-help")'.

   If you use Octave from within Emacs, it is best to add these
settings to your `~/.emacs-octave' startup file (or the file pointed to
by the Emacs variable `inferior-octave-startup-file').

============

The following identifiers are keywords, and may not be used as variable
or function names:

`__FILE__'               `__LINE__'               `break'
`case'                   `catch'                  `classdef'

   The function `iskeyword' can be used to quickly check whether an
identifier is reserved by Octave.

     Return true if NAME is an Octave keyword.  If NAME is omitted,
     return a list of keywords.

I.2 Parser
==========

The parser has a number of variables that affect its internal operation.
These variables are generally documented in the manual alongside the
code that they affect.  For example, `allow_noninteger_range_as_index'
is discussed in the section on index expressions.

   In addition, there are three non-specific parser customization
functions.  `add_input_event_hook' can be used to schedule a user
function for periodic evaluation.  `remove_input_event_hook' will stop
a user function from being evaluated periodically.

 -- Built-in Function:  add_input_event_hook (FCN)
 -- Built-in Function:  add_input_event_hook (FCN, DATA)
     Add the named function FCN to the list of functions to call
     periodically when Octave is waiting for input.  The function should
     have the form

          FCN (DATA)

     If DATA is omitted, Octave calls the function without any
     arguments.

     *See also:* *note remove_input_event_hook:
     doc-remove_input_event_hook.

 -- Built-in Function:  remove_input_event_hook (FCN)
     Remove the named function FCN from the list of functions to call
     periodically when Octave is waiting for input.

     *See also:* *note add_input_event_hook: doc-add_input_event_hook.

   Finally, when the parser cannot identify an input token it calls a
particular function to handle this.  By default, this is the function
"unimplemented" which makes suggestions about possible Octave
substitutes for MATLAB functions.

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = missing_function_hook ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = missing_function_hook (NEW_VAL)
     Query or set the internal variable that specifies the function to
     call when an unknown identifier is requested.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply
it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains
in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
     on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
     non-source form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
     with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
     for which an implementation is available to the public in source
     code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
     scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include
     the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
     associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
     is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
     given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License
     acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
     provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
     you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
     provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
     conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
     terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
     copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
          as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
          the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access
          to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated
          by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
          the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
          as needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product
     is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
     installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
     has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied
     when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
     operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
     with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be
          marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
          version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
     conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
     material governed by the terms of that license document, provided
     that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
     conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
     the third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
     licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
     possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
     predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
     with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
     exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
     initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
     lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
     using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
     portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
     contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
     "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
     agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under
     which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of
     your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
     party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
     work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made
     from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
     specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
     unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
     was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
     at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
     collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
     terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
     the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
     version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html'.
