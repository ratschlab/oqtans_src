@node Style Tips
@section Writing Clean Octave Programs

Here are some tips for avoiding common errors in writing Octave code
intended for widespread use:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Since all global variables share the same name space, and all functions
share another name space, you should choose a short word to distinguish
your program from other Octave programs.  Then take care to begin the
names of all global variables, constants, and functions with the chosen
prefix.  This helps avoid name conflicts.

If you write a function that you think ought to be added to Octave under
a certain name, such as @code{fiddle_matrix}, don't call it by that name
in your program.  Call it @code{mylib_fiddle_matrix} in your program,
and send mail to @email{maintainers@@octave.org} suggesting that it
be added to Octave.  If and when it is, the name can be changed easily
enough.

If one prefix is insufficient, your package may use two or three
alternative common prefixes, so long as they make sense.

Separate the prefix from the rest of the symbol name with an underscore
@samp{_}.  This will be consistent with Octave itself and with most
Octave programs.

@item
When you encounter an error condition, call the function @code{error}
(or @code{usage}).  The @code{error} and @code{usage} functions do not
return.
@xref{Errors}.

@item
Please put a copyright notice on the file if you give copies to anyone.
Use the same lines that appear at the top of the function files
distributed with Octave.  If you have not signed papers to assign the
copyright to anyone else, then place your name in the copyright notice.

@node Coding Tips
@section Tips for Making Code Run Faster.
@cindex execution speed
@cindex speedups

Here are some ways of improving the execution speed of Octave programs.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Vectorize loops.  For instance, rather than

@example
@group
for i = 1:n-1
  a(i) = b(i+1) - b(i);
endfor
@end group
@end example

@noindent
write

@example
a = b(2:n) - b(1:n-1);
@end example

This is especially important for loops with "cheap" bodies.  Often it suffices
to vectorize just the innermost loop to get acceptable performance.  A general
rule of thumb is that the "order" of the vectorized body should be greater or
equal to the "order" of the enclosing loop.

@item
Use built-in and library functions if possible.  Built-in and compiled functions
are very fast.  Even with a m-file library function, chances are good that it is
already optimized, or will be optimized more in a future release.

For instance, even better than

@example
a = b(2:n) - b(1:n-1);
@end example

@noindent
is

@example
a = diff (b);
@end example


@item
Avoid computing costly intermediate results multiple times.  Octave currently
does not eliminate common subexpressions.
Also, certain internal computation results are cached for variables.
For instance, if a matrix variable is used multiple times as an index,
checking the indices (and internal conversion to integers) is only done once.

@item
Be aware of lazy copies (copy-on-write).  When a copy of an object
is created, the data is not immediately copied, but rather shared.  The actual
copying is postponed until the copied data needs to be modified.  For example:

@example
@group
a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a; # no copying done here
b(1) = 1; # copying done here
@end group
@end example

Lazy copying applies to whole Octave objects such as matrices, cells, struct,
and also individual cell or struct elements (not array elements).

Additionally, index expressions also use lazy copying when Octave can determine
that the indexed portion is contiguous in memory.  For example:

@example
@group
a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a(:,10:100); # no copying done here
b = a(10:100,:); # copying done here
@end group
@end example

This applies to arrays (matrices), cell arrays, and structs indexed using ().
Index expressions generating cs-lists can also benefit of shallow copying
in some cases.  In particular, when @var{a} is a struct array, expressions like
@code{@{a.x@}, @{a(:,2).x@}} will use lazy copying, so that data can be shared
between a struct array and a cell array.

Most indexing expressions do not live longer than their `parent' objects.
In rare cases, however, a lazily copied slice outlasts its parent, in which
case it becomes orphaned, still occupying unnecessarily more memory than needed.
To provide a remedy working in most real cases,
Octave checks for orphaned lazy slices at certain situations, when a value
is stored into a "permanent" location, such as a named variable or cell or
struct element, and possibly economizes them.  For example:

@example
@group
a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a(:,10:100);  # lazy slice
a = []; # the original a array is still allocated
c@{1@} = b; # b is reallocated at this point
@end group
@end example

@item
Avoid deep recursion.  Function calls to m-file functions carry a relatively
significant overhead, so rewriting a recursion as a loop often helps.  Also,
note that the maximum level of recursion is limited.

@item
Avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily.  When building a single result
matrix from a series of calculations, set the size of the result matrix
first, then insert values into it.  Write

@example
@group
result = zeros (big_n, big_m)
for i = over:and_over
  r1 = @dots{}
  r2 = @dots{}
  result (r1, r2) = new_value ();
endfor
@end group
@end example

@noindent
instead of

@example
@group
result = [];
for i = ever:and_ever
  result = [ result, new_value() ];
endfor
@end group
@end example

Sometimes the number of items can't be computed in advance, and stack-like
operations are needed.  When elements are being repeatedly inserted at/removed
from the end of an array, Octave detects it as stack usage and attempts to use a
smarter memory management strategy pre-allocating the array in bigger chunks. 
Likewise works for cell and struct arrays.

@example
@group
a = [];
while (condition)
  @dots{}
  a(end+1) = value; # "push" operation
  @dots{}
  a(end) = []; # "pop" operation
  @dots{}
endwhile
@end group
@end example

@item
Use @code{cellfun} intelligently.  The @code{cellfun} function is a useful tool
for avoiding loops.  @xref{Processing Data in Cell Arrays}.
@code{cellfun} is often used with anonymous function handles; however, calling
an anonymous function involves an overhead quite comparable to the overhead
of an m-file function.  Passing a handle to a built-in function is faster,
because the interpreter is not involved in the internal loop.  For example:

@example
@group
a = @{@dots{}@}
v = cellfun (@@(x) det(x), a); # compute determinants
v = cellfun (@@det, a); # faster
@end group
@end example

@item
Octave includes a number of other functions that can replace common types of
loops, including @code{bsxfun}, @code{arrayfun}, @code{structfun},
@code{accumarray}.  These functions can take an arbitrary function as a handle.
Be sure to get familiar with them if you want to become an Octave expert.

@item
Avoid calling @code{eval} or @code{feval} excessively, because
they require Octave to parse input or look up the name of a function in
the symbol table.

If you are using @code{eval} as an exception handling mechanism and not
because you need to execute some arbitrary text, use the @code{try}
statement instead.  @xref{The @code{try} Statement}.

@item
If you are calling lots of functions but none of them will need to
change during your run, set the variable
@code{ignore_function_time_stamp} to @code{"all"} so that Octave doesn't
waste a lot of time checking to see if you have updated your function
files.
@end itemize

@node Comment Tips
@section Tips on Writing Comments

Here are the conventions to follow when writing comments.

@table @samp
@item #
Comments that start with a single sharp-sign, @samp{#}, should all be
aligned to the same column on the right of the source code.  Such
comments usually explain how the code on the same line does its job.  In
the Emacs mode for Octave, the @kbd{M-;} (@code{indent-for-comment})
command automatically inserts such a @samp{#} in the right place, or
aligns such a comment if it is already present.

@item ##
Comments that start with a double sharp-sign, @samp{##}, should be aligned to
the same level of indentation as the code.  Such comments usually
describe the purpose of the following lines or the state of the program
at that point.
@end table

@noindent
The indentation commands of the Octave mode in Emacs, such as @kbd{M-;}
(@code{indent-for-comment}) and @kbd{TAB} (@code{octave-indent-line})
automatically indent comments according to these conventions,
depending on the number of semicolons.  @xref{Comments,,
Manipulating Comments, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

@node Function Headers
@section Conventional Headers for Octave Functions
@cindex header comments

Octave has conventions for using special comments in function files
to give information such as who wrote them.  This section explains these
conventions.

The top of the file should contain a copyright notice, followed by a
block of comments that can be used as the help text for the function.
Here is an example:

@example
## Copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 2007 John W. Eaton

## usage: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
##
## Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  COMMAND
## specifies the name of the command to start.  ARGS is an
## array of strings containing options for COMMAND.  IN and

## or -1 if COMMAND could not be executed.
##

##
##  [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-nr");
##  fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
##  fclose (in);
##  while (ischar (s = fgets (out)))
##    fputs (stdout, s);
##  endwhile
##  fclose (out);
@end example

Octave uses the first block of comments in a function file that do not
appear to be a copyright notice as the help text for the file.  For
Octave to recognize the first comment block as a copyright notice, it
must start with the word `Copyright' after stripping the leading
comment characters.

After the copyright notice and help text come several @dfn{header
comment} lines, each beginning with @samp{## @var{header-name}:}.  For
example,

@example
@group
## Author: jwe
## Keywords: subprocesses input-output
## Maintainer: jwe
@end group
@end example

Here is a table of the conventional possibilities for @var{header-name}:

@table @samp
@item Author
This line states the name and net address of at least the principal
author of the library.

@example
## Author: John W. Eaton <jwe@@octave.org>
@end example

@item Maintainer
This line should contain a single name/address as in the Author line, or
an address only, or the string @samp{jwe}.  If there is no maintainer
line, the person(s) in the Author field are presumed to be the
maintainers.  The example above is mildly bogus because the maintainer
line is redundant.

The idea behind the @samp{Author} and @samp{Maintainer} lines is to make
possible a function to ``send mail to the maintainer'' without
having to mine the name out by hand.

Be sure to surround the network address with @samp{<@dots{}>} if
you include the person's full name as well as the network address.

@item Created
This optional line gives the original creation date of the
file.  For historical interest only.

@item Version
If you wish to record version numbers for the individual Octave program,
put them in this line.

@item Adapted-By
In this header line, place the name of the person who adapted the
library for installation (to make it fit the style conventions, for
example).

@item Keywords
This line lists keywords.  Eventually, it will be used by an apropos
command to allow people will find your package when they're looking for
things by topic area.  To separate the keywords, you can use spaces,
commas, or both.
@end table

Just about every Octave function ought to have the @samp{Author} and
@samp{Keywords} header comment lines.  Use the others if they are
appropriate.  You can also put in header lines with other header
names---they have no standard meanings, so they can't do any harm.

@node Documentation Tips
@section Tips for Documentation Strings

As noted above, documentation is typically in a commented header block
on an Octave function following the copyright statement.  The help string
shown above is an unformatted string and will be displayed as is by
Octave.  Here are some tips for the writing of documentation strings.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Every command, function, or variable intended for users to know about
should have a documentation string.

@item
An internal variable or subroutine of an Octave program might as well have
a documentation string.

@item
The first line of the documentation string should consist of one or two
complete sentences that stand on their own as a summary.

The documentation string can have additional lines that expand on the
details of how to use the function or variable.  The additional lines
should also be made up of complete sentences.

@item
For consistency, phrase the verb in the first sentence of a
documentation string as an infinitive with ``to'' omitted.  For
instance, use ``Return the frob of A and B.'' in preference to ``Returns
the frob of A and B@.''  Usually it looks good to do likewise for the
rest of the first paragraph.  Subsequent paragraphs usually look better
if they have proper subjects.

@item
Write documentation strings in the active voice, not the passive, and in
the present tense, not the future.  For instance, use ``Return a list
containing A and B.'' instead of ``A list containing A and B will be
returned.''

@item
Avoid using the word ``cause'' (or its equivalents) unnecessarily.
Instead of, ``Cause Octave to display text in boldface,'' just write
``Display text in boldface.''

@item
Use two spaces between the period marking the end of a sentence and the
word which opens the next sentence.  This convention has no effect for
typeset formats like @TeX{}, but improves the readability of the documentation
in fixed-width environments such as the Info reader.

@item
Do not start or end a documentation string with whitespace.

@item
Format the documentation string so that it fits within an 80-column screen.
It is a good idea for most lines to be no wider than 60 characters.

However, rather than simply filling the entire documentation string, you
can make it much more readable by choosing line breaks with care.
Use blank lines between topics if the documentation string is long.
 
@item
@strong{Do not} indent subsequent lines of a documentation string so
that the text is lined up in the source code with the text of the first
line.  This looks nice in the source code, but looks bizarre when users
view the documentation.  Remember that the indentation before the
starting double-quote is not part of the string!

@item
When choosing variable names try to adhere to the following guidelines.

@table @asis
@item 
vectors : x,y,z,t,w

@item
matrices : A,B,M

@item
strings : @nospell{str},s

@item
filenames : @nospell{fname}

@item
cells,@nospell{cellstrs} : c,@nospell{cstr}
@end table

@item
The documentation string for a variable that is a yes-or-no flag should
start with words such as ``Nonzero means@dots{}'', to make it clear that
all nonzero values are equivalent and indicate explicitly what zero and
nonzero mean.

@item
When a function's documentation string mentions the value of an argument
of the function, use the argument name in capital letters as if it were
a name for that value.  Thus, the documentation string of the operator
@code{/} refers to its second argument as @samp{DIVISOR}, because the
actual argument name is @code{divisor}.

Also use all caps for meta-syntactic variables, such as when you show
the decomposition of a list or vector into subunits, some of which may
vary.
@end itemize

Octave also allows extensive formatting of the help string of functions
using Texinfo.  The effect on the online documentation is relatively
small, but makes the help string of functions conform to the help of
Octave's own functions.  However, the effect on the appearance of printed
or online documentation will be greatly improved.

The fundamental building block of Texinfo documentation strings is the
Texinfo-macro @code{@@deftypefn}, which takes three arguments: The class
the function is in, its output arguments, and the function's
signature.  Typical classes for functions include @code{Function File}
for standard Octave functions, and @code{Loadable Function} for
dynamically linked functions.  A skeletal Texinfo documentation string
therefore looks like this

@example
@group
-*- texinfo -*-
@@deftypefn@{Function File@} @{@@var@{ret@} =@} fn (@dots{})
@@cindex index term
Help text in Texinfo format.  Code samples should be marked 
like @@code@{sample of code@} and variables should be marked
as @@var@{variable@}.
@@seealso@{fn2@}
@@end deftypefn
@end group
@end example

This help string must be commented in user functions, or in the help
string of the @w{@code{DEFUN_DLD}} macro for dynamically loadable
functions.  The important aspects of the documentation string are

@table @asis
@item -*- @nospell{texinfo} -*-
This string signals Octave that the following text is in Texinfo format,
and should be the first part of any help string in Texinfo format.

@item @@deftypefn@{class@} @dots{} @@end deftypefn
The entire help string should be enclosed within the block defined by
deftypefn.

@item @@cindex index term
This generates an index entry, and can be useful when the function is
included as part of a larger piece of documentation.  It is ignored
within Octave's help viewer.  Only one index term may appear per line
but multiple @@cindex lines are valid if the function should be 
filed under different terms.

@item @@var@{variable@}
All variables should be marked with this macro.  The markup of variables
is then changed appropriately for display.

@item @@code@{sample of code@}
All samples of code should be marked with this macro for the same
reasons as the @@var macro.

@item @@seealso@{function2@}
This is a comma separated list of function names that allows cross
referencing from one function documentation string to another.
@end table

Texinfo format has been designed to generate output for online viewing
with text terminals as well as generating high-quality printed output.
To these ends, Texinfo has commands which control the diversion of parts
of the document into a particular output processor.  Three formats are
of importance: info, HTML and @TeX{}.  These are selected with

@example
@group
@@ifinfo
Text area for info only
@@end ifinfo
@end group
@end example

@example
@group
@@ifhtml
Text area for HTML only
@@end ifhtml
@end group
@end example

@example
@group
@@tex
Text area for TeX only
@@end tex
@end group
@end example

Note that often @TeX{} output can be used in HTML documents and so often
the @code{@@ifhtml} blocks are unnecessary.  If no specific output
processor is chosen, by default, the text goes into all output
processors.  It is usual to have the above blocks in pairs to allow the
same information to be conveyed in all output formats, but with a
different markup.  Currently, most Octave documentation only makes a
distinction between @TeX{} and all other formats.  Therefore, the
following construct is seen repeatedly.

@example
@group
@@tex
text for TeX only
@@end tex
@@ifnottex
text for info, HTML, plaintext
@@end ifnottex
@end group
@end example

Another important feature of Texinfo that is often used in Octave help
strings is the @code{@@example} environment.  An example of its use is

@example
@group
@@example
@@group
@@code@{2 * 2@}
@@result@{@} 4
@@end group
@@end example
@end group
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
@group
@code{2 * 2}
@result{} 4
@end group
@end example

The @code{@@group} block prevents the example from being split across a
page boundary, while the @code{@@result@{@}} macro produces a right
arrow signifying the result of a command.  If your example is larger than
20 lines it is better NOT to use grouping so that a reasonable page boundary
can be calculated.

In many cases a function has multiple ways in which it can be called,
and the @code{@@deftypefnx} macro can be used to give alternatives.  For
example

@example
@group
-*- texinfo -*-
@@deftypefn @{Function File@} @{@@var@{a@} =@} fn (@@var@{x@}, @dots{})
@@deftypefnx@{Function File@} @{@@var@{a@} =@} fn (@@var@{y@}, @dots{})
Help text in Texinfo format.
@@end deftypefn
@end group
@end example

Many complete examples of Texinfo documentation can be taken from the
help strings for the Octave functions themselves.  A relatively complete
example of which is the @code{nchoosek} function.  The Texinfo
documentation string for @code{nchoosek} is

@example
-*- texinfo -*-
@@deftypefn @{Function File@} @{@} nchoosek (@@var@{n@}, @@var@{k@})

Compute the binomial coefficient or all combinations of 
@@var@{n@}.  If @@var@{n@} is a scalar then, calculate the
